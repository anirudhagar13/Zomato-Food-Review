The aloo tikki chaat and Papdi chaat were absolutely delicious. One of the best chaats I've ever had. After that, for starters, We had bhajji with various chutneys, and some salad. For main course, They served us the proper Rajasthani cuisine with my favoriteee Dal bhati churma! And they ended it with some yummy Kulfi.

The boxes too had the outlet name labeled.Chutney was packed in these nice small packs good enough for a plate of idly/vada.One drawback is that they do not have sambar similar to how quite a few places like Brahmin's thatte idly are known for.So, if you are one of those folks who doesnt like idly without the sambar, this is not the place for you or probably grab sambar from somewhere else !The idly's were good but could have been softer, the vegetable dosa was satisfactory. Vada and Ghee upma was the best of the lot. Upma was packed with flavors. Vada was nice and crispy.The place is titled as a coffee outlet which probably could throw off some people who do not know that they also have food available, I was one of them thinking that its just a coffee place until I referred the same in Zomato !

So, we took another two scoops in separate cups. They serve 100gms in one cup, you can also divide it into two flavours 50gms each. I think the amount is pretty amazing for a cup. As my mother insisted to take a cup of her favourite Extra White ice cream, we went for one cup of it and another cup of Chocolate Truffle. Both the flavours were insteresting and we loved them.The portions are commendable, pricing is perfect with no added taxes and the flavours seem great with the freshly churned rich cream. Sitting area and the decor consists of everything white, that would soothe your eyes definitely. This place is highly recommended for trying out the high quality ice creams and I can guarantee that you would have a lovely time with your loved ones. Happy Dining! :)"

S"Again this find was based on Zomato and thank God for it. We had the pleasure of eating the best Upma here and later at MTR. Madly crowded, you have to almost stand on the head of people already eating. Sadly, that's the only way you would manage a table.Then, there are no menus and the only display menu on a wall was in Kannada which again didn't help. So had to ask the waiter what all was available. Idli wasn't but Upma and Masala Dosa was, so that was it and loved both.The Upma can not be softer and better while the Dosa is small, light but crisp. Sadly, you have to ask for Sambhar, that too would be served in very little quantity. Apparently, they don't want to get into serving it with so many people around. Had the Filter Coffee to end the meal and went more crazy.Missed Sambhar badly but loved the food. And, it is super cheap."

After waiting for around 20mins for a table, the waiter had no interest to take our orders. Got us half the stuffs n forgot a few. The dosa was just as average as you find at any dosa outlet around. The kara bhath was tasteless rava with some salt n seasoning added jus for heck of it. Rava idli was even worse. The only tasty dish was kesari bhath.

The place is open till 12:30 in the afternoon and we were right on time. Even though it was not a typical breakfast time, it was still pretty crowded. The interiors are normal and a bit congested but who cares as long as the food at the end of the day is great! Ctr has 2 floors for seating so you can find quite a number of tables to sit at. Since it was closing time and waiter insisted us to order everything at once, we went ahead and ordered their specialties 1. Benne Masala Dosa: Really crispy dosa's @cause of the butter that is added to it. Served alongside the normal coconut chutney and then a Pudina chutney. Every bite of the Dosa, you get that wonderful taste of the butter. Who doesn't love butter? The dosa's are relatively small and could easily have 2 of them at once. The potato pulya was also yummy and I would gladly say it was something which everyone in Bangalore should try! 2.Coffee: Normal Strong Filter coffee which we had to end the yummy meal! The servers are quite nice and comfortable to talk to  and Each dosa is like 50 bucks which is really good for the quality we get. An amazing place and will keep visiting as in when I can!"

We had a rava idli, their trademark bene (butter) masala dosa, plain bene dosa and filter coffee (can't do without this). Trust me your visit to this place is incompetent w/out having their bene masala dosa. Honestly, the rava idli was not so great but the dosas were piping hot, crispy and glazing (because of the butter). I really haven't had such delicious dosa before.!

It's an old building located at the corner of a street. The ambience is pleasant, cultural, historical, rustic and busy. Their bestseller is the Masala Dosa, for which the restaurant has won numerous awards.   I ordered the famous Benne Masala Dosa, Poori, Idli, Vada and Coffee.   Started off the breakfast with quick bites of Idli and Vada. They were served with Coconut Chutney and Sambar. The Vada is deep fried, crispy outside and soft, moist, crumbly inside. The crunch sound while taking bite gives all the pleasure in the world. The sweet and sour sambar is a great accompaniment along with the vada.    The Idlis are steamed and thus super soft. It's crumbly, fermented, fresh, hot, light, moist and flavourful. The Chutney has a salty, spices and grated coconut flavour.The Benne Masala Dosa is served with Potato Palya and Pudina and Coconut Chutney. The Dosa is thick, cooked with some extra butter and looks Mouthwatering. The outside is rigid, crispy and shallow fried to deep brown colour, while the inside is soft, crumbly and moist. The Dosa was well cooked and tastes Divine with the accompaniments.   Poori is served with Coconut Chutney and Vegetable Saagu. The Pooris are nicely soft and puffed up, crisp on the top and thick in the bottom. It's a stomach filler, and tastes spicy, sour and oily along with Saagu. The Saagu could be better."

I wanted  aloo along so i asked the waiter an he got it without any hesitation. The poori bhaji was amazing. Then came the benne dosa, i lved how crisp and tasty it was. Mouthwatering literally, served with sambhar and amazing coconut white chutney which i ate entirely. Then came rava idly, the idly was good. We then ordered filter kaapi. Amazingly strong taste.

I wanted  aloo along so i asked the waiter an he got it without any hesitation. The poori bhaji was amazing. Then came the benne dosa, i lved how crisp and tasty it...'

Their delicious iconic Benne Masala Dosas help you forgive all the butter/ ghee rather easily. If there was just ONE thing we were allowed to have for the rest of our lives, it would be their benne saagu dosa. . yumm!They also sell some of *the* best mangalore bajjis in town, so don't forget to try them the next time you visit CTR!"

The Shanghai Chicken Dimsum was the best of the lot, it was really yummy, non spicy for the kids, and they loved it. The crabmeat omelet was a disappointment, there was no salt, and the crab meat was not soft, may be it wasn't fresh. The egg fried rice was good. The dessert, apple fritters with blueberry compote and ice cream was bad. The fritters themselves were bland, the apple not sweet, and the batter used for the fritters not tasty. The blueberry compote didn't help, there was too little of it. The fritter needs to be sweeter. Somehow it didn't work for me. The place is fantastic though, well lit, beautifully decorated, and that tree in the middle is very well placed. Tim Tie deserves another try, will definitely go without kids and try the spicy stuff.

And on the side farthest from the entrance was a small area secluded by a glass wall, with a mini waterfall inside. Yes, a waterfall. Unfortunately, this area was out of service for some reason, and it was during my visit to the washroom that I came across this beauty.  As for our order, unluckily, I don't remember the names of the dishes that we had ordered (feel free to caption in comments the photos that I have uploaded), other than the basket of steamed momos. What I do remember is that all the items were quite satisfactory and filling, especially the momos. Moreover, I had already fallen in love with the place, and the preparations would have had to be horribly bad to change my mind.

The starter arrived soon and looked heavenly. We loved the peanut sauce that came with it. They nailed the Satay unlike other places which just serve meat or veggies on a skewer. The flavour was authentic and the dish was presented well. The main course was the star of the show. Nasi goreng which literally translates to fried rice was upscaled and brought back memories of Indonesia. The fried garlic and onions added to the taste. We contemplated about having dessert but decided to have more food. We went ahead and ordered Indonesian bamee noodles.

They had invested a lot on expensive machines such as dishwashers and all the staff had appropriate kitchen clothing. Really impressive.What I didn't like: There is always a huge crowd, and they don't serve sambhar with any of the dishes.Food:a) Masala Dosa: Ample quantities of ghee makes it so delicious !b) Vada: Crunchy to perfection and soft on the inside !c) Filter Coffee: Definitely one of the best in bangalore ! &"

Coffee didn't come at all, so we just ignored it. By this, you should know that you have to be really very patient. There are too many people and it might take quite some time for your orders to reach your table. The dosey is comparatively smaller in radius and if you want sambar, you need to ask for it. It's not given along with it by default, like in other South Indian Hotels. I'd say, If you're a Bangalorean and you haven't been here, it's time you do.

We thought to give it a try and went almost 15km opposite of Avalabetta journey. To my surprise I don't feel this place as good as they say about it as Legendary.  We waited for almost 20min for 4 masala dosa's to get served to us. The potato masala was overcooked and the batter for masala dosa is of Ragi and not Rice. We also ordered Kharabhat which was perfectly cooked. This is a very small place in the heart of basavanagudi and you will find it crowded between 6:30am till 10am."

First of all, it is more of a dhaba (a little more elegant maybe) than a caf\xc3\xa9. The place is located little inside the main road where you would not imagine it to be. It is an area where you might find a garage kind of a place, but it\xe2\x80\x99s good that there is sufficient parking. The place has a rural touch. The Punjabi culture phrases on the walls make it very interesting; I especially enjoyed reading the \xe2\x80\x98fun facts about punjabis\xe2\x80\x99 more so because being a Punjabi I could relate to most of these. So ambience wise it is a decent Punjabi place to be in.But I was disappointed with the food which was way too spicy and oily than it should have been. I know Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich gravies and flavor, but this one was low on flavor and it was just too oily and a lot spicy taking it to the unhealthy side. The alloo jeera in my thali was undercooked and the butter paneer masala was just high on masalas. The green chutney was watery. Alloo parantha was a little better in that sense, with good and proper filling but I felt if you are serving one parantha in the range of Rs 50'

S'It\xe2\x80\x99s been five years since Punjab Grill opened its doors and introduced us Bangaloreans to authentic Punjabi khanna fit for the kings.

Well even though it was degustation menu, with Punjabi food, it\xe2\x80\x99s pure hedonistic in every sense. From \xe2\x80\x98utterly butterly\xe2\x80\x99 delicious rotis to sinful starters and the most innovative concoctions to accompany it.

I\'d say don\'t try indianised cocktails.. they werent that great. Oh and the pan shot at the end of it was lovely! You don\'t need to have any dessert.. just ask for one more pan shot. Taste wise, I\'d place this restaurant higher than barbecue nation and somewhat similar to Punjabi by Nature.<span></span>'

Considering that the price for the buffet is reasonable, your expectations too are toned down. The food does taste good and is also helped with courteous service. The lack of too many dishes also lets you pick what you want to eat and have your fill. Malpua is made too thick and thus not crispy. Ironically, the dal tadka and ghee rice are not too tasty.

First and foremost, I want to express condescending shock and disappointment for the lack of courtesy and civility of the staff and management of this hotel. Linguistic/Community discrimination was rampant here. So, my friend and I, who're south Indians casually walk in, conversing in Kannada, our mother tongues, and were treated like insignificant creatures. We ordered 2 Rotis and a curry and waited for the longest 45 minutes of our lives. Two other tables of North Indian folk conversing in Hindi and Marathi respectively, who arrived after us were served much before us (For the record, I have a lot of North Indian friends and have nothing against them!) . We ran out of patience when the other two tables were ready for dessert and we were still waiting for the damn roti and curry. The bias display was pretty clear. We finally lost it and confronted the manager, who seemed to understand our predicament and offered a complimentary dish, which our bruised egos obviously repudiated. We left after giving a piece of mind to the management who're making money off Bangaloreans, but refuse to interact in the local language and treat customers differently, leaving the overdue Rotis untouched. I'm never going back in there and wouldn't recommend it. I was obviously too pissed to be taking notice of the ambience. Super disappointed!"
