S"The Indian Coffee House is a restaurant chain in India, run by a series of worker co-operative societies. It has strong presence across India with nearly 400 coffee houses, but has a clear Kerala connection.The India Coffee House chain was started by the Coffee Cess Committee in 1936, when the first outlet was opened in Bombay. In the course of the 1940s there were nearly 50 Coffee Houses all over British India. It was during the late 1890s that the idea was formed.Due to a change in the policy in the mid 1950s, the Board decided to close down the Coffee Houses. Encouraged by the communist leader A. K. Gopalan(AKG), the workers of the Coffee Board began a movement and compelled the Coffee Board to agree to handover the outlets to the workers who then formed Indian Coffee Workers' Co-operatives and renamed the network as Indian Coffee House. A co-operative began in Bangalore on 19 August 1957, and one was established in Delhi on 27 December 1957. Later Bellary and Madras (Chennai) Societies were separated from their mother societies."

Though it seems like a place where hygiene would be of concern, they do maintain good hygiene.They are well known for south Indian breakfast items like dosa, idli and vada, khara baath and the like. Being a south Indian myself, I absolutely love everything they have. The chutney they make is stupendous! The filter coffee is just on point and gives you that boost you need for the day!

It was good, and was prepared nicely.it was not very spicy or bland but made me feel it has been cooked at home.Overall I would say more than food I liked the ambiance and the way of serving food.In the end, you will be surprised with a postbox to give you the bill."

The experience was so drastic, that we walked out just after being served our starters.So here goes, on reading rave reviews about this place, we decided to visit the place instead of our usual dine out which is the same segment as this place in Koramangala. We got a table with much difficulty for a later slot our dinner time, but we were excited about this place but it was a small glitch.we were welcomed with very warm staff at the entrance and then the captain escorted to our table. Wow, the smells and smoke in the place is unbelievable. and not in a good way. I mean someone with a cold or sinus can be cured here, the burning charcoal and the smell of food is very over powering.And if that was not enough the bills were coming in medium sized post boxes, food on small cart wheels/ charpouy, miniature looking tandoor, water was served in goblets, food was sizzling out of the kitchen...i mean imagine the setup, all this chaos and people chattering away...coz the noise reduction is quite bad. You can hear every word being spoken at the next table. So my end impression, was that a food stylist had puked all over the restaurant.Our starters arrived which was a portion of Paneer for the poor vegetarian being me and Chicken Kabab for the kids and hubby. paneer was the usual affair where you can't complain much but wasn't anything special either. However when the chicken came out of the skewers, my husband actually gasped in horror. There were 5 thin strips of boneless chicken which is no condition would have sufficed as a portion for 2 adults, or 2 kids and a adult."

The prices are on the higher end but yeah you feel its worth it. Coming to food,Starters: Thai Crispy Vegetable(One of the best Oriental dishes Ive tasted, it was very well made and went well with sauce they gave), Street Style Spicy Dumplings( Below average, for some reason didnt find it spicy and worth the money for the quantity provided.

S'Was planning Mamagoto for a long time. Thinking of the traffic would end up ordering freshmenu.com. This Sunday, thought of being a bit Oriental and wifey was also feeling like having Thai. So started the search for an "Asian" dining place for lunch. Having read good reviews of Mamagoto, thought would try. Opened up the menu option of Zomato (really like this feature of the Zomato product) and it read Thai all over. Decision was made. We have no qualms of trying any restaurant which serves some level of Thai food. Called them up and they said that they are sold out. We just wanted a tablet for two, so we decided to just try they walkin tables, even though on phone they said it\'s not available. It would be becoz of our lack of punctuality. To get our table we are in the habit of saying 5 minutes without turning up well past 20 min in reality. We were there in 15 min and got a seat. Food was excellent.'

We had 4 different flavours of ice cream which were all amazing in taste. We've also tried their Ice cream cake slice and this too is the best ever.

Both their gelatos and sorbets are top notch.  And the flavours !! Some of the best I have had in my life. Very different from standard flavours you get elsewhere. Some flavours will make you wonder how can those tastes even be combined together but these are geniuses at work, the same people who are involved in Fort Kochi.

After all, travelling across the town is a lot of pain :) MUST Try for ice cream / dessert lovers. ** update ** Went a second time , and this time tried the Truffle Icecream.

Hence, this review will always reserve a special place in my heart. As it was the last review, we both decided to celebrate with the family.I was wondering such high ratings would serve extremely high quality ice creams and was disappointed at no point.We had taken a sample platter consisiting of four scoops of different flavours of your choice, freshly whipped cream and hot chocolate sauce. We chose -Extra White (felt like eating a white chocolate ice cream.)Wildberries (rich with flavours of berries, this is more of a sorbet, very refreshing.)Tiramisu (had hints of coffee, which is more dominant in a tiramisu icecream, but what special is that you could also taste the mascarpone cream cheese, simply loved it!)Orange Cheesecake Gelato (a new kind of ice cream, very different flavour, all of us liked it.)Stomach was full but not to our heart's content. So, we took another two scoops in separate cups. They serve 100gms in one cup, you can also divide it into two flavours 50gms each. I think the amount is pretty amazing for a cup. As my mother insisted to take a cup of her favourite Extra White ice cream, we went for one cup of it and another cup of Chocolate Truffle. Both the flavours were insteresting and we loved them.The portions are commendable, pricing is perfect with no added taxes and the flavours seem great with the freshly churned rich cream. Sitting area and the decor consists of everything white, that would soothe your eyes definitely. This place is highly recommended for trying out the high quality ice creams and I can guarantee that you would have a lovely time with your loved ones. Happy Dining! :)"

Madly crowded, you have to almost stand on the head of people already eating. Sadly, that's the only way you would manage a table.Then, there are no menus and the only display menu on a wall was in Kannada which again didn't help. So had to ask the waiter what all was available. Idli wasn't but Upma and Masala Dosa was, so that was it and loved both.The Upma can not be softer and better while the Dosa is small, light but crisp. Sadly, you have to ask for Sambhar, that too would be served in very little quantity. Apparently, they don't want to get into serving it with so many people around. Had the Filter Coffee to end the meal and went more crazy.Missed Sambhar badly but loved the food. And, it is super cheap."

The crunch sound while taking bite gives all the pleasure in the world. The sweet and sour sambar is a great accompaniment along with the vada.    The Idlis are steamed and thus super soft. It's crumbly, fermented, fresh, hot, light, moist and flavourful. The Chutney has a salty, spices and grated coconut flavour.The Benne Masala Dosa is served with Potato Palya and Pudina and Coconut Chutney. The Dosa is thick, cooked with some extra butter and looks Mouthwatering. The outside is rigid, crispy and shallow fried to deep brown colour, while the inside is soft, crumbly and moist. The Dosa was well cooked and tastes Divine with the accompaniments.   Poori is served with Coconut Chutney and Vegetable Saagu. The Pooris are nicely soft and puffed up, crisp on the top and thick in the bottom. It's a stomach filler, and tastes spicy, sour and oily along with Saagu. The Saagu could be better."

S'Finally after a long wait, today I went to this place with my friend. As soon as we entered we got place to sit. When server came to ask our order without hesitation we ordered two Benne Masala Dosa.. For this only I travelled 20kms early on Saturday morning.. So I was  eagerly waiting for my Masala Dosa and finally it came..  The Dosa was so rich in butter... You can feel that when the first piece goes into your mouth.. This is one of the best Masala Dosa I ever had in Bangalore.. So when I finished my first Dosa I ordered again one more Masala Dosa and my friend ordered Kesari bath and coffee.. I never drink coffee but when my friend described about the coffee I really wanted to try... This was our experience in CTR today.. Everyone in Bangalore should go and taste their food...'

S'Shri Sagar (CTR) aka Central Tiffin Room is the oldest South Indian breakfast place in Bangalore.Its Benne Dosa also called as the Malleswaram Dosa has been unanimously awarded as the best Masala Dosa in the country by various food critics and most importantly, The Hindu. I take The Hindu very seriously. No nonsense.On our recent trip to Bangalore, our trip would have been incomplete without a meal at CTR. Had it for dinner on Day 1. I like to be in the company of legends. I am as old school as they come. Nonetheless, I never enter biased. Never.How we three love regular veg South Indian food! In my review of Vinayaka Mylari in Mysore, I have elaborately explained what bastardization of food is.

But CTr kills it for me. The benne plain is ultimate. If your in for an overload of ghee ,crispy golden dosas ,you are in for a treat. The red chutney they put inside the dosa is delicious.The ghee dosa goes perfectly with their filter coffee which is nice an strong.it comes in traditional steel glasses.

This place has received various award and one of it was for benne dosa, so i had to try that out. Puri sabzi came, a set of 3 puri and sambhar. I wanted  aloo along so i asked the waiter an he got it without any hesitation. The poori bhaji was amazing. Then came the benne dosa, i lved how crisp and tasty it was. Mouthwatering literally, served with sambhar and amazing coconut white chutney which i ate entirely. Then came rava idly, the idly was good. We then ordered filter kaapi. Amazingly strong taste.

S"Went to Tim Tai with a lot of expectations, had heard from friends this is a great place for Asian food. I must say I was a bit disappointed. The Shanghai Chicken Dimsum was the best of the lot, it was really yummy, non spicy for the kids, and they loved it. The crabmeat omelet was a disappointment, there was no salt, and the crab meat was not soft, may be it wasn't fresh. The egg fried rice was good. The dessert, apple fritters with blueberry compote and ice cream was bad. The fritters themselves were bland, the apple not sweet, and the batter used for the fritters not tasty. The blueberry compote didn't help, there was too little of it. The fritter needs to be sweeter. Somehow it didn't work for me. The place is fantastic though, well lit, beautifully decorated, and that tree in the middle is very well placed. Tim Tie deserves another try, will definitely go without kids and try the spicy stuff. That will decide."

We had gone for a weekend lunch, which is conventionally considered to be a quiet affair at restaurants, but this place was just teeming with liveliness. The wonderful decor, done up in sober shades of yellow, peach and brown, must have been a catalyst. A tree stood right at the center of the establishment, which seemed to hold the place together. And on the side farthest from the entrance was a small area secluded by a glass wall, with a mini waterfall inside. Yes, a waterfall. Unfortunately, this area was out of service for some reason, and it was during my visit to the washroom that I came across this beauty.  As for our order, unluckily, I don't remember the names of the dishes that we had ordered (feel free to caption in comments the photos that I have uploaded), other than the basket of steamed momos. What I do remember is that all the items were quite satisfactory and filling, especially the momos. Moreover, I had already fallen in love with the place, and the preparations would have had to be horribly bad to change my mind.   Tim Tai definitely deserves a visit, as much for the interiors as for the food. And don't forget to order their steamed momos if you do make it there."

So we ended up sharing. I could only taste 2 out of 4 types and liked one of them due to its spicy taste. I am not good at remembering chinese dishes but we ordered a noodles, a rice and 2 veg dishes. All i can at a broad level was that the food was amazing.

Whoever did the decor of the restaurant has wonderful taste. We arrived and were seated immediately... Since there were six of us we ordered for the following  Drinks- cinnamon and orange iced tea, Mandarin feast, Asian Mary and one Lady love.  Starters- spicy Soya and basil dimsum, Thai styled grilled chicken with green apple Som Tam, Lotus stem with honey chilli and a Tom yum soup  Main course- Thai red curry, Burmese curry with plain rice, phad Thai noodles and lamb and leeks with black pepper sauce.  We all loved our drinks except for the Mandarin drink everything else was fresh and flavourful. Asian Mary was absolutely perfect in terms of flavour. Right mix of basil, Tabasco and guava. The soup was clear and had lots of vegetables with a strong hint of lemon grass. Light on the tummy. We enjoyed all the starters- the marination on the chicken was absolutely perfect and it looked as if it had penetrated the chicken completely. Wasnt too charred too. Served with the green apple the sweet and sour balance of flavours was spot on. I have to say the Lotus stem surprised us all. Fried and coated in honey chilli sauce it was perfect. Dimsums were moist. Slightly chilly for me but didn't lack any flavours."

The ambiance was nice and our waiter was courteous. We placed the order for vegetarian Satay platter and nasi goreng. For the beverage we went with mandarin feast and lemon grass. The drinks didn't take much time to come and tasted good. We loved the flavour that was infused and the fact that it was not brain freezingly cold or diluted. The starter arrived soon and looked heavenly. We loved the peanut sauce that came with it. They nailed the Satay unlike other places which just serve meat or veggies on a skewer. The flavour was authentic and the dish was presented well. The main course was the star of the show. Nasi goreng which literally translates to fried rice was upscaled and brought back memories of Indonesia. The fried garlic and onions added to the taste. We contemplated about having dessert but decided to have more food. We went ahead and ordered Indonesian bamee noodles. The flavour was very similar to the rice and we realized we should have ordered something else but we can save that for next time. This place has amazing food and good service.

Our entrees Roasted Chilli and Basil Fish along with Indonesian Bamee Goreng Noodles. To our surprise, instead of a stir fried, it was a actually a crispy fried fillets stirred with vegetables in a chilli and basil sauce - giving it a nice crispy, spicy flavour. The noodles had typical a indonesian flavour of sambal.  On small note to the restaurant management, the restrooms were extremely dirty and water was all over the floor. This can be a huge turn off.'

S"Tim Tai ,as the clever name suggests is a chic restaurant in Kormangala serving Thai, South east Asian and Asian fusion dishes. They have a modern casual atmosphere with an upscale Asian look. The tree inside the restaurant really stands out for me.  The ambience on its own is a major selling point and makes it an ideal place to hang out .  Ordered the Tom Kha soup, seafood soup with a coconut milk broth,galangal and Thai basil. Taste wise it was good and enough for two people however the soup was way too thick for a Thai soup. The body should have been lighter. Tried the chicken satay which was perfectly cooked,moist on the inside with a delicious peanut sauce,however a bit too salty for my taste. A little less salt and it would have been a perfect dish. However the star of the night was the duck rolls. Peking style roasted duck with cucumber and scallions and an unnecessary dipping sauce which didn't add to the dish. The duck was very well seasoned and well cooked,probably among the best duck rolls I had. Strongly recommended. The service got off to a bumpy start as despite it being a not so busy weeknight our table was unattended for a while ,however the dishes came out quickly, though the pacing could have been better. That being said the staff were very warm and welcoming  I would go back and try more dishes."

S'Tim Tia is an Asian Fusion place in Koramangala and based on its Zomato ratings, our dining experience total matched our expectations. We started with a Non-Veg Dimsum Platter with a Raspberry Iced Tea. The dimsum platter came with 4 chicken, 2 lamb, and 2 prawn dimsums - out of which the lamb and shanghai chicken dimsums were the best. Our entrees Roasted Chilli and Basil Fish along with Indonesian Bamee Goreng Noodles. To our surprise, instead of a stir fried, it was a actually a crispy fried fillets stirred with vegetables in a chilli and basil sauce - giving it a nice crispy, spicy flavour. The noodles had typical a indonesian flavour of sambal.  On small note to the restaurant management, the restrooms were extremely dirty and water was all over the floor. This can be a huge turn off.'

S"So I thought real hard to try and find out faults with the lunch I had over here. Aaaaand I just couldn't come up with anything! Why not the perfect score ? Cause I feel there's always scope for improvement. Also cause the spinach gau dimsums weren't as impressive as the rest of the dishes severed. (Not that it was bad in anyway) So yeah the price may be a little on the higher side but its worth every penny. So stop scrolling through the rest of the reviews and reserve a table (highly recommended)."

S"Every time when I go to Jayanagar,  I make up my mind to go here but looking at the crowd I always return.So this time we went around evening before they opened,  thinking we  will be the only jobless people,  well well apparently all people came thinking the same :P      I expected people to lose patience and fight with each other looking at the crowd (that's how we roll :P) but they are quite disciplined and makes the whole process  hassle free, the queue for dosa does require some level of patience.       Coming to food,  I love the chutney and the lemony flavour to it, idlis I have eaten better ones in veena stores!!  And dose was with with utmost perfection( your patience pays off)  and the amount of tuppa you certainly wouldn't mind dying out of cholesterol :P,  coffee the best after MTR (brownie points for the cups), kept the star dish for the end Kesari bath FTW!!  I loved the veena stores one,  but this was way better and they even Add pineapple to it which makes it even more amazing. The most amazing part more than Kesari bath was I just paid 75 bucks for all of it (you Ll medium fries in that cash) you can always get clean,  hygienic tasty food for less rate :P"

All items are very less price..U eat and fill tummy as much u can...only thing u have to wait in queue to get items...Taaza thindi is awesome place in Bangalore to have breakfast\n-\nI would definitely give them 5 on 5 because they are by far the best breakfast hub when it comes to South Indian food. All the time full crowded yet getting your food won't take much time, however, dosa counters do need some level of patience. We do regularly visit the Jayanagar outlet and ordering chow chow bath, idly vada and tea/bournvita is a must. Fluffy and soft idlis along with my personal favorite tangy lemony chutney - something to definitely die for. Dosas are a bit oily though but simply love the taste and flavor.Neat and clean ambiance, hygienic food and above all, super pocket friendly. What more do you need for a great sumptuous breakfast? Highly recommended.\n-Pocketfriendly and very tasty and the price of 1990 u get all the dishes of menu below 25rs, has an award for most hygienic restaurant in Bangalore"

S"Been wanting to eat here for so long, finally made up my mind, packed my cycle and went. Wow, what an experience. Thought I'll catch them early and be the only one when they open, reached by 7.15 am, and there is a queue already!! Thought I'll have to fight it out to get my food, but no. Suddenly I see people behaving and standing in line patiently. There is a queue for everything, hence you get your food quicker than most darahinis even if it's super crowded. Once you pick up your food, want chutney, there is a separate counter. You love the vada and want one more, but see the queue for coupon and want to leave it... well there is a guy who is floating around and you can top up there. Different counters and queues for idli, dosa, coffee make it very organised. And clean. Very clean. Food wise, I like the chutney in Veena stores better, but loved the idli and vada. Just too good. But the best part, what TT is proving to us, is good, clean food doesn't need to be expensive. 1 plate idli vada and 1 coffee cost me 40 rupees. In this day and age, anywhere else it's not possible. Overall, big respect for Taaza Thindi. They deserve the 4.9 rating on Zomato completely.\n-Been wanting to eat here for so long, finally made up my mind, packed my cycle and went.

But the best part, what TT is proving to us, is good, clean food doesn't need to...-No need to use ur grey cells of brain to figure out why dis place is jam packed... It was my first time over here the first thing that stoods out is the crowd and probably one myt thing it will take a long time to get the food.... But it is so damn good organized the entire process its just mind blowing it just took me 2mins to get the food.... Also u can see the process how they are making the food and the cleaning as well in a proper sterilizer that u myt wonder dat are u in a 3 star restaurant..... Oh did I forget to tell the pricing just 20 for dosa and 10 for an idli.... Also luckily I got a coupon 4 a free coffee as well... Tastewise I wud say its the second best dosa I have had in bangalore..... Also the idli were damn soft and fluffy.... Go dere to believe it guys\n-I guess the best place to find yourself the meal. Its cheap and too tasty. How would you react when you get a masala dosa just for rs 20 and its finger licking good. The quality served is too good. Loved the place in whole!!\n-On a Monday morning around 8:30AM , this place was slightly crowded where they had queue system for both placing order and collecting food. Tried their Masala Dosa for 20 bucks and it was decent.One of those rest. where you can't really complain much because they ain't charging you a lot and entire menu of rest. is within 150 bucks .Food - 3.5/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 4/5Value for Money - 5/5\n-Very good place for some quick ,south indian delicacy like Kharabath( upgraded upma) chow chow bath ( duo ,kesari bath and kharabath duet) and Masala dosa yumm.... and u will get some nice hot filter coffee and tea...only these things  available over there with reasonable price and quick supply of them.It will be open from 9 to 12 pm and from 4 to 8 pm .Its located next to cake wala ,ssmrv college.Must visit once;)\n-The food is not bad. The food is no great shakes. Yes, the masala Dosa is good. But, it is not as delicious as the reviews make it out to be. The coffee is good.The crowd here after 7.15-7.30 is horrendous! A minimum waiting time for 20minutes in queue for food! So, yes, do try this place out to know what the hype is all about and move on in life. Be sure to get here by 7!\n-I had heard a lot about this place and the ratings, well, 4.9/5 on Zomato. It ought to be extra-ordinary. I thought the place was nice and they serve really good Dosas, Idlis and Vadas. Even though there is a queue here, you'd get your order pretty much quickly. The prices are so less that with 100 bucks, you'd be able to fill your stomach quite easily. The chutney was amazing, I mean, it was one of the bests I have ever had. This place doesn't have extra ordinary food, but the prices and its simple yet effective food, makes it a must visit place in Bangalore.\n-I could identify this place by the huge crowd waiting in line for food. The menu is very limited. The quantity of food is much lesser than what you would expect... But it is priced accordingly. The masala dosa is too good and a must try. The vada was pretty average. Service was extremely fast. Staff was courteous.Tip: If you want to skip the crowded payment counter, there is a guy inside the restaurant who can give you coupons.\n-A very good place to have regular south Indian delicacy like idli, vada, filter coffee.Tried idli vada, kharabhat, kesarbhat and filter coffee. Ambiance: Very crowded place you need to stand in queue for your order.Taste: Very good taste and very simple in flavours.Service: Very quick for idli and vada but for dosa you need to wait for at least 20 mins.Value for money: 9/10.-Great place for tasty breakfast. Very very very reasonable price for food not sure how they make money at this pricing but masala dosa for 20 seriously !!.. and food is really very tasty. In weekend queue is big Sonu might have to wait for 10 min approx but it's worthy ...\n-Everything is well prepared and of remarkable tasty. They are popular for south Indian breakfast food. They have a very limited menu but all are deliciously made. I liked the idly, its so soft like it will melt on your moth no need to chew. And the best part is they have unbeatable price rate.Recommended to all my friends coz once I tried the food there and now I have become a fan of this place."

S'Visited this place after looking at its rating on Zomato. The place was thronged by hundreds of people when we reached there. They define the actually fast food, I\'ve never seen service so fast in my life. Yes and their main advantage the cost of the food, but i wasn\'t impressed as it was a business strategy( 5/5 for the business strategy though). The quantity was half compared to other food joints hence the price cut as well which people fail to see. Their Masala Dosa (4.5/5) was very crispy and yeah it was small making peopleopt for one more. The chutney blends well. & Coming to Idli Vada (4/5). they were tiny as i described earlier but yeah felt it was worth it. Khara bath(4/5) Liked it but quantity was very very less and Kesari Bath(4/5) I felt it was yum but my friend who accompanied hated it for some reason. The joint is kept very clean and tidy and sevice is & excellent as is said. Seating for & a few is available but people prefer standing.Overall a nice experience and yeah would love to visit again.Ambiance: 3/5Food: 4.5/5Staff: 5/5Value for money: 4/5\n-Visited this place after looking at its rating on Zomato.

Visit it once and you will know why? Small place with no seating area. Just meant for a quick breakfast or evening snacks. The place gets very crowded unless you are early. You would either have to eat standing or find a make-do seating outside the restaurant. We had both Masala Dosa and Idly-Wada here. Cost the three of us under 200 bucks. When it comes to the food, you will have no reasons to complain. These are among the best that you would find in Bangalore. Go for Masala Dosa if you want a preferred choice. They give a great deal of importance to Hygiene. So, please don\'t worry about the quality. Recommend it always.\n-Nothing to beat the taste, cleanliness, and value of this place. I love the idlis, vadas and the chutney here. The coffee is pretty good too, most of the times, manage to drink 2 - 3 of them. Anyone in Bangalore must make it a point to visit this place at least one time!\n-Living in Malleshwaram, my expectation from South Indian food is higher solely because of the high standards set by the likes of veena stores, CTR, Hotel Janta and Raghavendra Stores. However the food at taaza thindi does indeed give good competition to these old establishments. The idlis are super soft and the masala dosa is super yummy. The Khara bath is quite different but super tasty and the coffee is great. Definitely a must visit for everyone. The super low prices and hygienic ambience is a plus over the delicious food.\n-I always wanted to eat here n today was that day ,the weather was perfect to have a plate of hot vada n to sip on a piping hot cup of coffee ,this place lives up to its reputation the food is amazing although they have a very limited menu ,what they have to offer is by far the best Indian breakfast that I have had ,the place is super clean ,management is amazing , only thing they could improve on is to go easy on the oil on the dosa but apart from that the food was amazing\n-Wat can u say abt this place... Just one word "awesome"They have raised the bar in hotel industry, hats off to their cleanliness and customer service. And the price ,    my god such a less price and the quality they give us amazing... Good work frm u guys keep going ... Wanna see more branches of urs in other areas ...\n-A Saturday morning stroll on this road after logging out of office introduced Me to this staple place.I came across a horde at 7am. Intrigued by this, I checked what was the deal about and I found a place serving piping hot South Indian staples.Eager to try the food here, I called a few friends and in a few mins We were all there gorging on delicious food.Their menu is limited, but all the items are yummy and worth a try.Hygiene, Taste, Quality &amp; Price... which We all look forward in an eatery are all taken care of an that seems to be their USP.This place is never to be missed. Strikes a chord with people of all age groups.The staff are friendly.Hygiene is a major draw for Me at this place.-Rated 4.9 on zomato, I was super keen on trying this place and I am glad I did. Nothing like the places I usually visit, this place is a LITTLE more than a street side idli-dosa stall- one of many you find in Bangalore. What sets this place apart is the level of cleanliness and hygiene, which is totally praise-worthy. The place has a very limited menu- plain and masala dosa, idle, vada, filter coffee is what I tried. I was immensely impressed by the dosa. It was fresh, filling and quite tasty. A point to note for all North Indians like me- Food is not served with SAMBHAR, only coconut chutney. I was honestly quite surprised by the price of each item- INR 20 for a Masala Dosa, that\'s very cheap for the quality they ensure. Finally, if you visit this place, be ready to stand in a queue and to eat standing up.\n-Very Good place for Breakfast or evening snacks.Not too many choices. The food is very decent with reasonable price. The Masala Dosa was the tastiest.\n-This place is like the role model for industrial revolution of restaurants... Everything is process driven to achieve perfection.. The prices are really pocket friendly and they have a limited menu... Was here for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 8 45 and this place was already crowded with a line for taking tokens... &Tried the idly and vada .. very well prepared and perfect on how it suppose to taste...Next was the chow chow bath, The holy combination of kesari bath and khara bath, tasted great as well.. As an icing on the cake you get half coffee free for khara bath and this costs you just 25 bucks.Last was the masala dosa, at 20 bucks you get hygienically well prepared  &dosa which tastes great...Wish I stayed this side of town to come here often :)\n-Finally made it to this popular no-frills joint! Only idlis and vadas were available (since we were there at 11:45) and both were excellent. Both came dunked in yummy homestyle chutney \xf0\x9f\x98\x8b Great coffee too. Super clean place and we got space to sit on the benches and enjoy our meal.\n-Visited this place on Thursday, at 9.00am with a friend who has visited this place before. I guess i was 15th person in the queue and my friend told " oh ! Its less crowded today !".This should give you an idea about the waiting.Hats off to the people who has patience to take pictures of their food and upload here.I just stuffed it as soon as i got it!Here menu is limited and price is less when you consider the tasty food. Commensurately the quantity is less.I ate 3 idli, 2 vada, 1 masala dosa and had 1 Tea!Dosa was oily but tasty.Idli and Vada were great.Even I tasted Karabhat it was good and different.If you are not staying nearby then both traffic and crowd in the hotel will test your patience. Better visit once and decide.'

S"Been here a few times for breakfast to satisfy my dosa cravings. This joint runs purely on the basis of the quality of food served. Every inch of the space available is occupied due to the inevitable rush throughout the week. You need to wait in long queues to get your order but the service is efficient. Have tried their idly, vada and dosas (plain/masala). The clear favourite among 90% of the mass is definitely the masala dosa. Being aware of that, they have it ready in bulk for fast service (freshly prepared). The dosas are quite oily due to the excess ghee but I assure you it's a healthy choice if consumed early in the day. \xf0\x9f\x98\x89 The other items on the menu are quite decent as well. They serve limited chutney on the plate but the customers can return for an additional serving from their chutney counter. The point being, they don't encourage wasting food. Almost forgot to mention the steaming hot coffee which ensures a great start to the day. Pricing is super reasonable ranging from 10-20 bucks per item. Also, they don't have a delivery or takeaway option. So if you want to avoid the large crowd and enjoy eating at home, you need to carry your own receptacles to parcel the food! I am assuming they don't support the use of plastic bags as well \xf0\x9f\x98\xac Overall, a must visit! \xf0\x9f\x99\x82\n-Been here a few times for breakfast to satisfy my dosa cravings.

S"Great value for less money. An amazing breakfast place hidden in the streets of Jayanagar. It is a very neat and clean restaurant with only few items in their menu. They have kept it less but did no compromise with the quality. A huge crowd turns up there every morning, still they manage the consistency in taste and quality. I decided to go there after seeing their rating on Zomato; it's the highest rated restaurant.The ambience is not something you need to worry about here. It's a small place but you will surely get place to sit after some wait probably.The food is quite amazing. We ordered Idli Vada and their famous cuisine Masala dosa. Masala dosa was the best, crisp and tasty. Idli was also very soft. However, they don't serve Sambhar but only Chutni.Service is the best thing there. They are real quick and in minutes you will get your food. They have separate counters for Dosa, Idli-Vada and Coffee/Tea which makes it easier for the crowd to receive their order, quicker also at the same time.Lastly and most importantly, it's very cheap. Even in 50 bucks, you can eat stomach full.This one is definitely challenging the Classic South-indian breakfast places of Bengaluru. However, I feel it's time for them to add new items to their menu now.-Great value for less money. An amazing breakfast place hidden in the streets of Jayanagar. It is a very neat and clean restaurant with only few items in their menu. They have kept it less but did no compromise with the quality. A huge crowd turns up there every morning, still they manage the consistency in taste and quality. I decided to go there after seeing their rating on Zomato; it's the highest rated restaurant.The ambience is not something you need to worry about here. It's a small place but you will surely get place to sit after some wait probably.The food is quite amazing. We ordered Idli Vada and their famous cuisine Masala dosa. Masala dosa was the best, crisp and tasty. Idli was also very soft. However, they don't serve Sambhar but only Chutni.Service is the best thing there. They are real quick and in minutes you will get your food. They have separate counters for Dosa, Idli-Vada and Coffee/Tea which makes it easier for the crowd to receive...\n-When you head to this restaurant on a weekend morning, be prepared to be greeted by long queues and no seating. This is yet another QSR with minimalist ambience and cheap yet hygienic South Indian breakfast. For the locals who're used to Veena stores and CTR in Malleshwaram, this restaurant wouldn't be any different but for a non local who discovered this place solely through zomato's high rating - it would be a bit of a shocker. If big crowds and standing road side in a cramped space to eat isn't your thing; please ignore this restaurant.The menu is simple and the prices do tend to shock you. No dish is priced more than 20 bucks. Must try: Masala Dosa. Let me fore warn you, no sambar is served here :) Also do try the Coffee.Meal for two: Maximum 100 bucks Note: There's no car parking anywhere close to the restaurant and you'd have to spend at least 15 minutes going around the neighborhood hunting for a free spot, on weekends. Don't think weekdays would be any different.\n-Amazing, amazing and just amazing. What a price, quality,  quantity they are giving. No one can beat their taste and maintenance. Must visit. Limited menu with unlimited taste.\n-I had come here once. I don't get the hype. Yes, food is good but it's not excellent and the fact that I have to wait 20 mins for my food and eat it standing at the roadside doesn't make sense. It's very inexpensive but then again it doesn't matter. You need to have at least two of the following.1. Great food2. Long Waiting 3. Place to sit\n-One more place off my wish list. However I am sure I want to keep it in my list to visit here again and again.Service was pretty fast, and plates as well as spoons were properly cleaned.Heavy crowd says it all. The attendants are really efficient and polite.Now, coming to food, there idly was really fluffy and melts right in mouth. Vada was very tasty, without too much oil. Masala dose were really crisp as well as thick, eating those with their chutney were soo good that we packed some for later.Just removed 0.5 points for much oil in Masala dose.It would never stop us from going here again and again.\n-Taaza as the name says it's always fresh and pure. One of the best place for South Indian food. The dosa rate has never hiked since it has been opened. Who gives a dosa for 20 bucks!?  These people here do and it is one of the finest cooked with the high end material. Idli for one will cost u 10 bucks. Coffee or tea is 10 again.. Coffee is just the perfect filter coffee and they don't compromise on the quanity though they giving it for 10.Kersaaaaari bath on of  the finest I have ever had. One thing I love about this place is the hygiene and the team work.. They never compromise on anything.. Just a perfect place.. I will be going again and aging and again till I die.\n-Holy Grail.When it comes to value-for-money breakfast experience, there is no beating this place. Its mesmerizing. It is a traditional Bangalore breakfast place with a modern twist. Their processes are very well organized to manage the crowd of such scale. They@ have exactly 13 items on the menu including extra butter and extra palya. There is no table chair seating, they have verandas and stand-n-eat platforms. Having been to CTR and other breakfast places, I can vouch for their service It is unlike what you ewould expect. The food is good. Masala Dosa is their highest selling item and rightly so. The dosa at Sri Guru Kotteshwara Benne Dosa is definitely better, but that place doesn't match the experience that this place provides. Tried the masala dosa, vada and badam milk at a total expense of Rs.50. Value for money at its best.Overall, its a  must visit, a temple for food lovers.Ambience: 5/5Service &amp; Staff: 5/5Food: 5/5Value for Money: 5/5"

I went there on a saturday morning and was disappointed first looking at the crowd. But exactly after 2 minutes I was out of the long queue with my idli, kharabath and also dosa. They have this amazing speed and order all in perfect place. The chutney here is too good, that no sambhar here is not even a bother. Their hygiene is also undoubted and perfect. The costs are very very minimal, all around 20 rs. I just loved this place!!\n-Don't call yourself a foodie if you haven't been here! The best masala dosa the best idlis and vadas. Mouth watering! And everything at the cheapest rate you cannot even think of :) Their cleanliness and maintenance is just next level. The importance they give to hygiene is much appreciated. As I write the review, the first thing m gonna do tomo morning is have idli vada here :p\n-This place is good for a quick breakfast and a good one too and if you got a limited budget no problem.  Eat tasty masala dosa and coffee and rush to work or better you can parcel it too.\n-Have just 20 bucks in your wallet? You think you can't go to a decent hotel? That's enough to visit this place. The quality of food is nothing less than any darshini in Bangalore. The masala dosa is coated with a spoon of ghee and chutney. The idli-vada combo is too good and the chow-chow bath also tastes really good. I love the fact that you can buy extra butter to eat with your dosa and this makes your experience so much more better. All the items on the menu costs 10 or 20 rupees and they haven't hiked the price since it's inception. I also love the fact that no matter what happens, the customers form a queue to collect their order. The hotel serves only chutney and no sambar. The place is a mad house on weekends and on holidays. But the quality of food is worth the wait. Must go."

S"Delicious and hygienic place for a south Indian meal ! They invested in these 2 (ignoring other aspects) and folks come here expecting a super experience on these two only. We tried Plain Dose, Masala Dose, Idli and Vada. Vada was hot and crisp - find this a rarity in most places. Idli melted easily in mouth. Dose seemed to have a special batter. They are thicker and crispier. Served with chutney only, sambhar lovers would be disappointed a bit. But then we didn't go there expecting sambhar - we wanted to experience what this place is known for.Couldn't help trying other delicacies (they have a small menu and they do full justice to each item) - chow-chow bath, kharabath and coffee. All were yummy.Special mention on hygiene - they use organic dish washing liquid and international dish washing equipment (can be seen by any visitor) and infra red equipment for disinfection of spoons.The place has limited seating and standing space. Designed deliberately I think so that people feel the high demand (most people will have to stand and eat). They manage the crowd well through the queue system and the staff was found to be friendly in spite of so much crowd to be managed.Finally, the prices are so reasonable that one wonders if they make a loss on per unit! Good for us and for them as they make money on volumes.\n-Delicious and hygienic place for a south Indian meal !

The staff reminded us that the qty of parathas might be too much for us and suggested ordering half of want we ordered and order again if required. Very thoughtful of the staff as we were visiting the place for the first time. The food was very delicious especially the parathas which were served with a large dollop of ghee!

S'I feel this place is a bit overrated. I have been wanting to visit this place since some time after reading raves on Zomato, but the place did not live up to the hype. First of all, it is more of a dhaba (a little more elegant maybe) than a caf\xc3\xa9. The place is located little inside the main road where you would not imagine it to be. It is an area where you might find a garage kind of a place, but it\xe2\x80\x99s good that there is sufficient parking. The place has a rural touch. The Punjabi culture phrases on the walls make it very interesting; I especially enjoyed reading the \xe2\x80\x98fun facts about punjabis\xe2\x80\x99 more so because being a Punjabi I could relate to most of these. So ambience wise it is a decent Punjabi place to be in.But I was disappointed with the food which was way too spicy and oily than it should have been. I know Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich gravies and flavor, but this one was low on flavor and it was just too oily and a lot spicy taking it to the unhealthy side. The alloo jeera in my thali was undercooked and the butter paneer masala was just high on masalas. The green chutney was watery. Alloo parantha was a little better in that sense, with good and proper filling but I felt if you are serving one parantha in the range of Rs 50-100, it better come with curd at least or we should get an option of getting curd instead of butter.I have been to a lot better Punjabi restaurants in Bangalore serving authentic food and at lower prices than this one, but seems like there is a dearth of such places in this area which is why this one is thriving!'

S"We opted this outlet for our team lunch today after a colleague of ours recommended this place having tried their other outlet in another part of the city. The restaurant has a plush ambience and had ample seating available and were able to get a table as soon as we entered. We ordered Paneer Tikka Multani for starters and some Shikanjvi and Aam Panna to go along. The drinks were very refreshing although the Aam Panna was a bit too sweet. We were assured that the Aam Panna was made from real raw mango pulp and not store bought Aam Panna concentrate. The paneer tikka was soft and flavorful although I personally am not a big fan of this dish of Paneer.Next we ordered for Patialashahi Kadai paneer, Rawalpindi chana and Indian bread basket for main course. The Kadai Paneer was mildly spiced and the gravy was again very flavorful with capsicums lending it's unique flavour. The Rawalpindi chana was moderately spicy and very well made with ginger juliennes and freshly chopped coriander as garnish.We couldn't have ignored our sweet tooth and hence ordered quintessential Kulfi and rose flavored Falooda. The Kulfi was not too sweet and had a creamy texture. The servers were attentive and polite. All in all a satisfying lunch except for their food pricing which in comparison to their taste of food is expensive. Here are my final ratings:Ambience: 4/5Food selection: 4/5Taste of food: 4/5Service quality: 4/5"

S"We opted this outlet for our team lunch today after a colleague of ours recommended this place having tried their other outlet in another part of the city. The restaurant has a plush ambience and had ample seating available and were able to get a table as soon as we entered. We ordered Paneer Tikka Multani for starters and some Shikanjvi and Aam Panna to go along. The drinks were very refreshing although the Aam Panna was a bit too sweet. We were assured that the Aam Panna was made from real raw mango pulp and not store bought Aam Panna concentrate. The paneer tikka was soft and flavorful although I personally am not a big fan of this dish of Paneer.Next we ordered for Patialashahi Kadai paneer, Rawalpindi chana and Indian bread basket for main course. The Kadai Paneer was mildly spiced and the gravy was again very flavorful with capsicums lending it's unique flavour. The Rawalpindi chana was moderately spicy and very well made with ginger juliennes and freshly..."

The quantities are really good too. Just ordered one naan, and that was good enough for me. I\'d say don\'t try indianised cocktails.. they werent that great. Oh and the pan shot at the end of it was lovely! You don\'t need to have any dessert.. just ask for one more pan shot.

I have always been a great fan of their dahi k kebabs....I just loved them...must order dish if you are here...But yea on my birthday, we ordered chicken and by mistake they served prawns. Which is definitely BIG blunder! Though I am a vegetarian but a friend of mine who ordered chicken were totally pissed off with them..She even had an allergy from prawns ...but they apologized and did everything they could do to compensate that! They brought us some complimentary sweet dish! But what could have been a pathetic exp didn't turn out that way. Their staff is pretty humble and north Indian food is also awesome! Their daal makhani is delicious and overall great food!So you can consider this place for north Indian food in Koramangala!"

All I could taste was an overload of chocolate sauce with not so tasty bits of waffle! I have had much better. I am not ruling out the place. Would probably try again.

Who says sorry when the ice cream rubs on to that rushing shirt is a matter for another day. You could have ignored all of this in a mall like Phoenix, where only one lift works on weekdays despite people queueing up, had the food been great. Ordinary ice creams on a waffle and not in it, could have probably worked at half the price at which they're dishing it out; it certainly didn't impress any of us.
