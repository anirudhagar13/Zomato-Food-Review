You would either have to eat standing or find a make-do seating outside the restaurant. We had both Masala Dosa and Idly-Wada here. Cost the three of us under 200 bucks. When it comes to the food, you will have no reasons to complain. These are among the best that you would find in Bangalore. Go for Masala Dosa if you want a preferred choice.

Have tried their idly, vada and dosas (plain/masala). The clear favourite among 90% of the mass is definitely the masala dosa.

The dosas are quite oily due to the excess ghee but I assure you it's a healthy choice if consumed early in the day. \ud83d\ude09 The other items on the menu are quite decent as well. They serve limited chutney on the plate but the customers can return for an additional serving from their chutney counter. The point being, they don't encourage wasting food. Almost forgot to mention the steaming hot coffee which ensures a great start to the day. Pricing is super reasonable ranging from 10-20 bucks per item. Also, they don't have a delivery or takeaway option. So if you want to avoid the large crowd and enjoy eating at home, you need to carry your own receptacles to parcel the food!
