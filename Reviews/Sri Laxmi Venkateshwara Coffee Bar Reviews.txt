-                                            A very small place serving amazing South Indian food. Though the menu is very simple, the taste is good and the price is totally worth it. My favorite is idli, vada and the hot refreshing filter coffee. However they serve only chatni and no sambhar.                                                             
-                                            Very good taste and quality... Must visit... One of the oldest outlets just like the veena at malleshwaram... Must try all in the menu... Always crowded...                                                             
-                                            Sri Laxmi Venkateswara coffee bar! Located in BSK 2nd Stage, Opp to park. This is really a quick bite restaurant üçΩ nearby. A very small outlet, where it's very old and they have cash counter, when u enter to your left side of the outlet. They have a token system for each item, where we need to go give the token to the person to give our order. The service was quick as it was crowd enough at the morning. Orderd idly and wada, just wanted to try these two. Idly was hot and vada was crispy enough to make us feel good. Chutney was not up to the mark, where chutney is the main source for these idly and wada. Planned to head soon, to taste other food item.                                                             
-                                            One of the oldest and yet coolest places at banashankari. This place hasn't changed with the years that I have grown up and yet it a beautiful place and the best place for a plate of idli and vada along with the famous ,mouth watering chutney!An old concept which is now copied by a lot of other new places that has opened up recently like by 2 coffee etc.So ,brahmins is by far the best but slv is not far behind. This is one of those places that has stayed for long and has lived to make the localities happy and doesn't care if it's not in one of those top must - have places in bangalore.They are the best with idli and vada but also serve mouth watering khara bath and dosas.This place has just managed to carve out a place for itself in my heart .Overall,Ambience -4.5(stand n eat outside )Staff- self serviceQuantity -4.5-                                            A bit overcrowded for obvious reasons this place is pretty old and serves authentic south indian food. Dowside: No place to sit and bit overcrowded as mentioned earlier.                                                            
-                                            I love to visit this coffee bar any no. of times for Idly and coffee...and always i find it's crowed.We have to lineup for tokens and then to collect your order. It's a self service hotel.They serve idli with chutney and is delicious. Idli is so soft and melts while eating. And tempts for one more idli.And after hot idli, its must to try filter coffee, which they are famous.-                                            I wonder how I missed reviewing this place. This is my childhood favorite.They have remained the same till date. The idili just melts in your mouth. They have a limited menu. Try the awlaki bhath, you will fall in love. This place is highly recommended                                                            
-                                            Best place ! No doubt! Just go on a weekday to enjoy their yum masala dosa becoz on Sundays they won't prepare dosa as the place shall be heavily crowded for breakfast! Must try is idli chutney, it's their signature dish and you'll be able to witness the sight of almost all the people carrying an idli plate along with other dishesüòÅ  do try! Go on weekday go enjoy masala dosa! Don't expect ambience and all just go n hurriedly eat n come back! Price is quite economical for their quality!                                                             
-                                            One of the best south Indian restaurant in the neighborhood. Known for its south Indian breakfast items like idli and dosas. Very good taste. Hygine. Nothing great about ambiance. Simple place.                                                            
-                                            Nothing flashy in this place and this eatery is all about simple yet amazing food. Perhaps the best place to have breakfast in bsk 2nd stage.  Best Idli-Vada                                                            
-                                            Best upma i had with amazing chutney. Right infront of a big park but parking is huge issue. Their coffee is good. Dosa not so great. The park infron of it is very beautifully done                                                            
-                                            A coffee shop right in front of bsk bda park.Masala dosa was not up to mark.But the chutney was great blend of taste.Coffee was served hot but not something great to point. Idily and kesari bath a must try.Price wise its costly compared to other such type of coffee shopes.                                                            
-                                            This one of the oldest eatery in South Bengaluru. The menu is like this -IdliVada Masala dosaKhara bathKesari bathRava idli And the most important COFFEE!!-                                            Do not miss this place! Great food for a good price and it tastes amazing. They give only chutney and no sambar, but somehow it tastes great in spite of that and you don't really feel the lack of sambar much. Expect the place to be crowded in the mornings, especially considering its small size, but that does ensure freshness of the food. A great place for breakfast if you don't mind standing and eating.                                                            
-                                            Best breakfast joint at Banashankari. Breakfast hangout for all Banashankari crowd. Idly, vada, kharabhaat with chetni is epic. Must visit place Sunday morning.                                                             
-                                            Awesome IDLI n VADA of the town. This is an ever crowded place. Have been visiting this place since more than 4 years. Try Idli with butter as an add on. It gives heavenly taste.

-                                            Crispiest vada in town! Chutney is heaven with idly uppittu. Coffee is good too. It's a very old food joint very famous for south Indian breakfast. Food is good, they need to maintain cleanliness.                                                             
-                                            It is very gud to eat... and u can enjoy the food to the core... dosa is the best... it can be affordable by every class of people... I enjoyed it very much...                                                            
-                                            This restaurant is beyond rating :)Worked / Partied all night? hungry kya?? SLV hein na...Whenever i am awake till 4 am, working or otherwise, i deliberately push myself till 6 am just to treat myself at SLV. Its a feast for taste buds and worth the wait.Idli and chutney here is dope! and trust me one would never have had a idli chutney like this anywhere in Bangalore, wait... anywhere in India I guess! Masala dosa is another killer. I am a die-hard fan of Khara Bath. No one makes an Upma like that.. not even my mother ;)Coffee-Tea is good too and so are all the items mentioned in the menu. I wish the place would have been a bit spacious coz it gets over crowded too easily. I guess few places are iconic and they need to stay that way! Nothing has changed in SLV since 30 years !The restaurant is open from 6 AM to 8 PM all days except for Sundays it is open till 12 PM.                                                            
-                                            SLV, opposite to the BDA park in Banashankari, serves the best idlies and crispiest vadas. I have been visiting this place for almost a decade. The taste is so consistent every time I go back. The kharabath is great as well. The place is pretty small, but the service is super fast. There isn't any place to sit, except for the steps of nearby shops and the park's steps, if you are willing to cross the road. It's a great breakfast place and the humble idly vada chutney from this place will definitely impress everyone                                                            
-                                            Masala dosa tastes good than every other food here. Kesari bath is also good. Place is small and crowded most of the time. Though the food tastes good, i feel few foods are over priced...                                                            
-                                            One word to describe it's unique recipe on Idli-Vada-Chutney - 'Simply Superb'. I found myself lucky to grab a plate whenever I pass on this restaurant. Pocket Friendly and Unlimited Chutney makes you feel food craving for this dish which they offer. Other dishes are good too.. Do try once and never miss an opportunity to visit this restaurant.                                                            
-                                            Nice place. Nice food. You get to eat some typical south indian food here. Masala Dosa and Vada are mouth watering. Do give a visit to this place if at all you happen to be somewhere nearby there.                                                            
-                                            Been going here since the time I was a kid. It is a small outlet with no seating area and it is forever crowded and the crowd just keeps increasing. In spite of the crowd, the service is really fast and you'll have your food fresh and hot in your hand in under 3 mins. Though it seems like a place where hygiene would be of concern, they do maintain good hygiene.They are well known for south Indian breakfast items like dosa, idli and vada, khara baath and the like. Being a south Indian myself, I absolutely love everything they have. The chutney they make is stupendous! The filter coffee is just on point and gives you that boost you need for the day! The prices of course are very cheap.A plate of masala dosa and vada in one hand accompanied by filter coffee in the other seated on the footpath with a couple of friends is a perfect formula for a lazy Sunday breakfast!                                                             
-                                            Being a fan of south Indian breakfast its hard for me not to like a legendary place like SLV which produces one of the best idli and dosa and the mouth watering chutney ......just amazing .......i remember this restaurant from when I was a kid......when ever I go to the devagiri temple I visit this place .....my grandpa  always celebrates his birthday here with his temple gang :P ...try the idli first! And then the dosa...prices are low and pocket friendly .....if ur a south Indian food lover this place is a must visit..........only complain its always crowded ! Other than that one the best darshini in Bangalore !                                                             
-                                            Limited menu. What IS available though, is outstanding. the chutney is lip smacking (no sambar- no complaints though). Be it the khara bath, idly, vada or the dosas, everything is excellent and goes perfectly with the chutney. Easy on the pocket as well. Head over if ur anywhere near bda complex, 2nd stage.                                                            
-                                            Slv banashankari- It just scores superbly well on all the parameters of food quality, freshness of the food, overall general upkeep (may be am partial on this front) and above all service quality and consistency in the quality of the food                                                            
-                                            This place is just a second one after our kitchen, words cant describe the taste here, only taste buds speak the moment idli, vada lands on the tongue                                                             
-                                            This place is always crowded at any point of time in a day. But it is worth to visit this place to taste the best idly's and crisp vada with chutney. They do not serve sambar,  but the chutney is very tasty. It is not spicy and very light with mustards. There is a boy who is seated just to serve the chutney. They will serve as much ad you want it. I also had khara bath here which I liked. It was hot and very tasty. There is no service, you should stand outside the hotel or stand under the tree to savour the taste from this hotel. Quite a place this is which surely has the right ratings !                                                              
-                                            One of those places that serves the best idli Dosa in the city, but doesn't get a mention in many places... Old place but taste is just brilliant, be it Idly Vada or Dosa. If you go to BDA Complex BSK, you've to definitely go here...                                                             
-                                            Top in town.... Nothing comes close. Best idli, vada n khara bath. Do not venture to other dishes. The chutney makes the difference... That's the secret sauce. Do not make the mistake of taking parcel, the chutney is just not the same. Going there for more than 15 yrs...you gotta give it to them for consistency... It remains just the same old........ Sigh :)                                                            
-                                            The best idlis in town ...they are so amazing that you have to reach here on time .. Otherwise they are finished .. It's a very old little shop hiding behind a tree.. But the crowd will make it noticeable..go before 8 you'll find yourself the best plate of idlis                                                            
-                                            " Full Time Fully Crowded by Foodies"This one a small place near BDA complex running from pretty long time with a fixed menu with fewer items. Kharabath, Maddur Vada and Dosa are must try dishes over here. All dishes served only with chutney, no sambar available here. Pocket friendly hotel. You need to eat in the middle of the clumsy crowd.                                                            
-                                            Small authentic south Indian eatery at bsk! You have only self service here. The awesome idly and khara bath u get here is heavenly. Coffee is also great. No cappuccino or latte can stand in front of it. Recommended!!                                                            
-                                            i have been to this place a couple of times .. and have even traveled from koramangala to eat over here... dosa or idli or vada take anything.. and u would forget the best of places where you would have eaten before.. the service is also too damn fast...                                                            
-                                            One of the legendary eat outs in bangalore. The place is a bit cramped, but the folks who visit this place hardly mind . Crowded during the morning hours and in the evening snack hours. Items available are idli vada, Masala dosa, Khara bath Kesari bath  served with coconut chutney . Just like any good authentic eat out, the Chutney is at its best . The chutney given for masala dosa is a bit different from the one they serve for idly. Vada is crispy , Kharabhat is cooked to perfection. A must visit place for any bangalorian.                                                            
-                                            Have been going to SLV for almost a decade now.. Nothing has changed about this place.. Situated opposite to Banashankari BDA Park.. This is a small place which serves some of the best south Indian Dishes in and around Jayanagar and Banashankari..AMBIENCE- Its a self service place with only stand and eat option.. Place is always crowded. It is clean..FOOD- The dishes available are idli vada, Masala dosa, Khara bath Kesari bath and few rice variants which are served with coconut chutney.... All the dishes are mouthwatering and a must try..SERVICE and COST: Service is quick.. Cost wise pretty cheap for the quality of food they provide..                                                            
-                                            Triple idly and crisp vade in that mouth watering unlimited chutney = HEAVEN on earth!!! Have been eating here for ages, still one of the best..                                                            
-                                            My mouth waters as I write this review....I love their kara bath and idlis...my favourite place for breakfast after a good jog at the park....so old,so good and so reasonable :)                                                            
-                                            Great place for idly. The quality and the taste has always been the same. Really a great place for eating and don't expect much on the service and ambience since it's just a fast food join!                                                             
-                                            You know how nowadays you have coke float in McDs, this place should call its items Vade Sambar float, Idli Chutney float...Being a pakka South Indian, my mouth waters as I write this review. I think now its got my brain too.

Breakfast, pre-mid snack,lunch, evening pastime... This is the place I chose always... Its indeed legendary.. ask the patrons here and they are going to tell you the plushness of this place :)Don't worry about the hygiene.. SLV is never going to disappoint youI have tasted each and every item on the menu displayed ..Idli,Vada,Chow Chow bath,the Dosas... the taste very delectable and is very gratifying.. Worth the money for the taste and quality.. If you are around BDA and wondering where to head for some South Indian fare...This is going to be the best bet... and yes do finish it off with one filter kaapi in style :)                                                            
-                                            This is a good south indian joint serving the Idly and Vadas.  It is quite popular with the morning walkers as well as the people looking for a quick bite. This is similar to Bramhins Coffee Bar and the menu is quite similar but with one exception that this has Dosas.  The idly and the vada are quite similar to the one in Brahmins with the vada quite crispy and the idly quite soft.  I personally don‚Äôt like the dosa here very much.The place can be quite chaotic when crowded as people push you around and there is no seatingVery reasonable however can have hygiene issuesVERDICT: Worth a visit -                                            I've been eating at SLV for over 20 years, and as it stands, the quality of food has gone down. Prices have increased(inevitably) but the quantity has decreased, which is disappointing. Also, the favour of the chutney has deteriorated, and feels to watered down. Also noticed that the chutney isn't very consistent in its composition. Still, the Khara Bath and Masala Dosa are very good and Ruth visiting for.                                                            
-                                            Visit this place for a quick south Indian breakfast. The Idli-vada is just out of this world! I love it here. Also, uppit-kesri baath is a must try. The menu has masala dOse apart from the above. It used to be good but nowadays, masala dOse on Saturdays are prepared early and served as and when orders come and that is something I didn't like though. DOse is not available on Sundays at all.But, a good eat nonetheless.                                                            
-                                            Crispy Vada, Masala dosa, coffee.. Morning is complete with these at SLV Banashankari. One of best quick eat out in Bangalore, if you like to have best south Indian breakfast in city, you should visit this place once.                                                            
-                                            Morning coffee lovers of Banashankari 2nd stage can be found here. Crispy Masala Dose, mouth watering Vada sambar and this place is famous among locals for thier chutneys!!Lotta rush on peak hours. Only negative is about the place is chaos ( some like it, really) .                                                             
-                    Another quick eat south Indian restaurant similar to Bramhins Coffee Bar. Comparatively this has one more extended menu: Dosa.  Usually crowded on all time and over crowded at week ends. There is no Que system in this restaurant, getting your order may feel like an adventure (if you have multiple order; god may help you :P) We were lucky enough to get our order 3 plates of Idli-Vada in just 15 minutes on a weekend, Idli was soft and really tasted good, Vada was roasted properly and tasted different than Bramhins Coffee Bar. But, Chutney: It was not up to our expectation. One who have tasted Bramhins Coffee bar Chutney will easily score down this chutney. Since its weekend we didn't dare to order Masal Dosa.Over all a decent famous outlet with lack of customer management. If management takes care of que system and quick service it will attract more customers. Hygiene is one more concern; Chutney pouring  guy sits next to footpath with open bucket of chutney which definitely leaves a mark on hygiene demanding people. Parking wouldn't be a problem since you can find many sub mains in 500 mtrs radius.FINAL VERDICT: If you are near by definitely a visit in a month is worth, and others can visit this once or twice before tasting Bramhins Coffee bar chutney. ;)-                        Another quick eat south Indian restaurant similar to Bramhins Coffee Bar.

-                                            Grew up in the locality eating very often here. The evenings with crisp vada..idly with benne  coffee with the 'battaree' who sits collecting money and providing the coupons. The chutney is its trademark with mouth melting idly. Very popular joint .fond memories of the place ...seen the plate of idly rise from 6 rs to 25 now in span of 20year though..                                                             
-                                            This is one of the quick breakfast before Hatti Coffee and By 2 Coffee. This is one of the legendary restaurant located opposite to BDA Complex.. Famous for Idly Vada, Masala Dosa and Khara bath... I am visiting frequently to this restaurant..Favorite restaurant for morning walkers and very much familiar for the people located in BSK 2nd Stage..I strongly recommend this restaurant to all south Indian food lovers.. This is as equivalent as Bramhin's..Crowded all the time..Overall:-                                            This place is old and is really famous among the south bangalore, This place is located on main road, and is small, BUt u cant miss this out because it has of huge group of people standing outside and munching the tasty delights. They have the authentic idli vada chutney, dosas, kharabath, Maddur vada. Everything tastes good here, Pocket friendly too. You could see a huge number of people mostly on weekends that too for breakfast. Idlis are served hot.You can try this place for early morning breakfast or eve snacks.
