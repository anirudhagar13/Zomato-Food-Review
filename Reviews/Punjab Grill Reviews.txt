There was perfect marriage of flavors. Must try dish that has elements of Smokey spicy and citrus beautifully imbibed. The Tamarind foam further added to its flavors.Raan â€“ Unmissable roasted lamb leg delicacy here served with toasted almonds and rosemary chutney foam, well done to suite the Indian palate.

-                    We opted this outlet for our team lunch today after a colleague of ours recommended this place having tried their other outlet in another part of the city. The restaurant has a plush ambience and had ample seating available and were able to get a table as soon as we entered. We ordered Paneer Tikka Multani for starters and some Shikanjvi and Aam Panna to go along. The drinks were very refreshing although the Aam Panna was a bit too sweet. We were assured that the Aam Panna was made from real raw mango pulp and not store bought Aam Panna concentrate. The paneer tikka was soft and flavorful although I personally am not a big fan of this dish of Paneer.Next we ordered for Patialashahi Kadai paneer, Rawalpindi chana and Indian bread basket for main course. The Kadai Paneer was mildly spiced and the gravy was again very flavorful with capsicums lending it's unique flavour. The Rawalpindi chana was moderately spicy and very well made with ginger juliennes and freshly chopped coriander as garnish.We couldn't have ignored our sweet tooth and hence ordered quintessential Kulfi and rose flavored Falooda. The Kulfi was not too sweet and had a creamy texture. The servers were attentive and polite. All in all a satisfying lunch except for their food pricing which in comparison to their taste of food is expensive. Here are my final ratings:Ambience: 4/5Food selection: 4/5Taste of food: 4/5Service quality: 4/5-                        We opted this outlet for our team lunch today after a colleague of ours recommended this place having tried their other outlet in another part of the city.

-                                            Itâ€™s been five years since Punjab Grill opened its doors and introduced us Bangaloreans to authentic Punjabi khanna fit for the kings. To commemorate its 5th anniversary, Punjab Grill hosted a special dinner with a 16 course degustation menu(yes you heard me right, 16 courses) called the Punjab Grill Signature Series. Well even though it was degustation menu, with Punjabi food, itâ€™s pure hedonistic in every sense. From â€˜utterly butterlyâ€™ delicious rotis to sinful starters and the most innovative concoctions to accompany it. I think my tummy even did its own version of a happy dance to the hit number Kaala ChasmaðŸ˜‰                                                                ...                                        
-                                            Good service and good food. The buffet offers limited items in main course but starters are many and you won't be disappointed, (both veg and non veg). Do give it a try when you are around kormangla.                                                            
-                                            A pretty expensive place but the punjabi food served is delicious. The service was really amazing. A perfect place for family with nice ambience and courteous staff. Tried their rum gulab jamuns.. I must say was mouth watering. A must must try.. The tricks they do with fire on your table, surprises you and the taste of gulab jamun post that rum and fire is heavenly.                                                             
-                                            Nice place.. loved the food specially the beetroot peanut tikki, stuffed mushrooms and specially the biryani... The spices in the biryani was perfectly touched the cooking.. perfect place for a perfect evening... :)                                                            
-                                            This is definitely the best north Indian food that I have had so far in Bangalore - would recommend all "Punjabi by Nature" fans to try this one out. Amazing palak paneer and tawa veg. The quantities are really good too. Just ordered one naan, and that was good enough for me. I'd say don't try indianised cocktails.. they werent that great. Oh and the pan shot at the end of it was lovely! You don't need to have any dessert.. just ask for one more pan shot. Taste wise, I'd place this restaurant higher than barbecue nation and somewhat similar to Punjabi by Nature.<span></span>                                                             
-                                            Punjab Grill, the gourmet fine dining restaurant is the place to go for Bangaloreans looking for a dose of authentic Punjabi food! Their specially crafted menu caters to both the vegetarian and non vegetarian palette. This coupled with the excellent service of the extremely courteous staff made the experience an unforgettable one! Whether it's a family outing or a romantic dinner for two, the ambience is perfect for all occasions and the food is a winner!

-                                            I feel special occasions can be planned here looking after ambience, seating arrangements , varieties of veg items, fast servicing. We ordered all veg stuffs like paneer Tikka Multani, malai kofta( must try its sweet and spicy ) Everything was very nicely prepared. Cost of all items are a bit higher, but the quantity of curry and starters is sufficient for 3-4 persons. Waiters were quite generous to respond to our concerns. Everywhere you will get a welcome drink, here you will get shots of drinks while you are about to leave. :)                                                            
-                                            This place was long due since it's inception in NCR. Went on my birthday with my friends. It was a good experience. Though we had all veg that day, I truely enjoyed it. Little heavy on wallet but can be visited occasionally with friends and family.                                                            
-                    I have been a regular visitor to Punjab Grill, Gurgaon outlet. And a great fan of that place. So I was already having high hopes from this place in Koramangala also. And frankly I wasn't disappointed!I went to this place for celebrating my birthday, I liked their ambience. Pretty classy and chic Dim lights, nice sofas! I have always been a great fan of their dahi k kebabs....I just loved them...must order dish if you are here...But yea on my birthday, we ordered chicken and by mistake they served prawns. Which is definitely BIG blunder! Though I am a vegetarian but a friend of mine who ordered chicken were totally pissed off with them..She even had an allergy from prawns ...but they apologized and did everything they could do to compensate that! They brought us some complimentary sweet dish! But what could have been a pathetic exp didn't turn out that way. Their staff is pretty humble and north Indian food is also awesome! Their daal makhani is delicious and overall great food!So you can consider this place for north Indian food in Koramangala!                                        
-                        I have been a regular visitor to Punjab Grill, Gurgaon outlet. And a great fan of that place. So I was already having high hopes from this place in Koramangala also. And frankly I wasn't disappointed!-                                            This place is located in Koramangala. The first thing you would notice about this place is that it has a very big dining space including open air options. The restaurant has a classy decor with different table options - sofa, 2 persons, 4 persons, 6 persons..so on so forth. Dim lights and nicely done interiors. It has a live bar.The black uniformed staffs are quite efficient and suggestive. Given the fact that we went in around 10pm on a Friday night with quite many customers the service was very prompt as they has lot of staffs...We ordered:Plain NunMakki Di RotiChicken Lababdar - The gravy was just awesome.            -                                            Its a cozy restaurant with really amazing north indian food. I think if you just order the starters and the desserts - you'll be done. You wouldn't need the main course. This is exactly what happened to us. The starters - Dahi ke sholay, Paneer tikka and something chicken masala (my friends ordered it, I am a vegetarian) were also delicious and the quantity is very generous.The deconstructed fancy kulfi faluda was as yummy as it was reminiscent of the childhood. You must also try their pan shots - Yes you heard it right !!The staff is warm and service is quick. I suggest the outdoor area to sit !!                                                             
-                                            I did not find anything outstanding about this place. A bit expensive looking at the quality of food. Very normal food with decent ambience. It's like tht one movie, which you can even skip if u want.                                                            
-                                            A visit with colleges. We choose the 1299 buffet. The food was tasty. However, the options are limited. Ambiance is good. Desserts were great!The final pan drink was the icing on the cake. Overall a good experience but a hole in the pocket.                                                                                                        
-                                            First thing I must say about this place is great ambience and fine dining. Appetizers were amazing especially the paneer. Main course were equally good but a bit on spicy side so make sure to ask your server to tone down spice level if you are not a huge fan of spicy food but highly recommended place to go!                                                            
-                                            It was one of the restaurants in my list which I had a lot of buzz in fine dining...the restaurant is at a very good location which make it more accessible.The service and staff is very courteous and quick....The ambience is fine with large sitting arrangements but with the space they have it can be much better.Coming to the food they have very good dishes but then also I find the menu to be bit limited.The price is bit high but to the quality of food and service they provide some can ignore it.The shorbas were normal nothing extraordinary, the non veg starters were great specially the chicken starters were yummy and tender.In main course of course the hero was the mutton keema naan and the chicken curries were really good.-                                            been once and I must say, food items especially non-veg which were available were really good.But they need to enhance their menu w.r.t. Starters and improve main-course as well                                                            
-                                            Finally got to visit this well known restaurant.Located in the heart of Kormangla right opposite to the famous Forum.I must say this is one of the best Punjabi food places in Bangalore.I tried the Kadhai chicken and it was mind blowing.A must try for all the spicy food lovers.Chicken lababdar is a fantastic option too and i was totally wowed with the taste.Mutton galauti kababs were very average and I would suggest one must skip it as it is not worth it.Overall with the service, ambience and quality of food this restaurant will always satisfy you.However it is slightly on the costlier side                                                            
-                                            I would just like to add that it was not a good experience for me when I visited this place. The menu card arrived late, we were sitting outside, seemed like nobody cared.The starter arrived after we finished our main course, which is really not acceptable from a fine dining restaurant, which actually charges you a bomb and that too its not main course arrived very early or something, everything took its own sweet loongg time. Service really needs to be improved. Food was fine. ðŸ˜Š                                                            
-                                            The place is located in a quite a busy place. Very good ambience and fantastic food. The platters may be less but the main course you order will be lot for you to handle. Not so cost friendly.. The lassi here is the must try.. Its amazing                                                            
-                                            I had been there for lunch, I decided to go there after seeing reviews.  We ordered veg platter, lassi n aam panna, but disappointed with the taste of kababs.  Lahori seekh kababs were a bit raw, vegetables were not cooked properly,  corn kababs were not good in taste. But dahi kababs and paneer tikka weee good. Beverages were good. Veg biryani was really good with awesome taste. N finished with pan shots, good one.Ambiance is no doubt awesome.                                                             
-                                            I was there for my husband's bday, awesome location, perfect n welcoming ambience. We were escorted to our table by a lady who had called us to confirm our booking. So coming to the food... We had khumb peshawari which was quite spicy, portion sizes were good but didn't expect it to be so spicy. Main course we had paneer lababdar n tandoori rotis. Curry was good in taste n mild spicy,the way I want my curry to be. Paneer was too good n soft n just melted in our mouth. Rotis were huge in size. Overall a nice place for special occasions to spend quality tym with ur loved one. Found it to be lil overpriced but once in a while is ok I feel.                                                             
-                                            Beautiful place to go for amazing Indian food. The non veg was really delicious, starting from the kebabs and the curries we ordered. Very soothing and calm restuarant to have a lovely time with your loved ones. We had pan drink at the end, a complimentary drink from their side and it was very tasty :). In terms of money, this will lil hard on your pocket but the amazing service and food quality will make upto it...Worth visit!!                                                            
-                                            Recommend this place for a good meal, maybe lunch maybe dinner. Nice bar section to sit and have a beer before the meal. Good for both family and groups.                                                            
-                                            This is right next to raheja arcade. A really nice place and yummm food(vegetarian). It's really tasty. My friend told even the nonveg food is very tasty. But it's on a costlier side. Just for 3-4 dishes it came upto 2k. The pan shots they give at the end is lovely.                                                              
-                                            One of the finest place in Koramangala for North Indian food. I was craving Ulte Tawa Ka Paratha so had to go there. It still tastes the same and melts in mouth within moments. Dahi ke kebab would just burst as soon as in contact with the mouth. Paneer was grilled to perfection. Now I'm broke but totally worth it!                                                            
-                                            A class place in kormangla, visited once with friends. Food and service both are very good. Liked grilled chicken , prawns also samlon fish.                                                            
-                                            The food is something which is just charismatic here with perfect blend of spices, authenticity of Punjabi cuisine is well maintained. Though one has to be conscious while ordering as the servings are good enough, loved the desert and starter kebabs. Must recommended place for lavish lunch and dinner!
