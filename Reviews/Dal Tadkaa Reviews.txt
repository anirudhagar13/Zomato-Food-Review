-                                            I had been to this place yesterday. It was a sudden plan though. So I got go find this restuarant on the way. This place has a cute Rajasthani ambience. The waiters are friendly. We ordered baby corn pepper dry .. which I liked the most. We also ordered palak paneer. Which was good enough. They have amazing daal baati thali too.
-                                            If you want to enjoy bland food with no noise around then Dal Tadkaa is the place. Authentic Rajasthani fare with a wide variety of food. Sarson ka saag (seasonal), all types of rotis and mithai are must try. A place worth visiting for those looking for a changeAmbience: 3.5Food: 3.5Service: 4
-                                            We visited Dal Tadka on a weekday. The overall experience of dining at Dal Tadka is average to above average. Considering that the price for the buffet is reasonable, your expectations too are toned down. The food does taste good and is also helped with courteous service. The lack of too many dishes also lets you pick what you want to eat and have your fill. Malpua is made too thick and thus not crispy. Ironically, the dal tadka and ghee rice are not too tasty. But, the overall experience is pleasant.Good place to dine if you are in Banashankari area.
-                                            I had heard a lot about this restaurant hence I went to try it out.I was disappointed. The pulkas were dry ,the sabzi tasteless,the tikki undercooked and the veg pulav didn't have a balance of masalas.The ambiance of the restaurant was good but what's a restaurant worth without good food. We decided never to visit again.
-                                            Ordered home delivery. The food was delivered on time and delivery guy was courteous. But the food was equally bad. Palak panner had no taste and panner was not at all fresh. Veg pulao was also very bad had no taste or spice. I dont think i would like to order again unless i see reviews of improvement.
-                                            Now it's not very fair to review this restaurant now as it's been a very long time the last time I was there.  But I do remember it so here it goes! It was on a weekend for a buffet lunch. Variety is normal like everywhere else but the service was quite good. There wasn't much in terms of desserts but hey for that price we didn't expect much as well. A place that you can skip without worrying of missing something!
-                                            ordered paneer butter masala and rotis and naans for home delivery ... the breads were well packed but the gravy was hugely disappointing ... i had stomach uneasiness for hours after eating the food meaning its old or rotten food ... totally unhealthy and not worth it if they cant make a simple gravy ... i can only imagine how the remaining items are
-                                            Very highly priced restaurant. Food is not good both quantity and quality wise. Just that the interiors they have made differently which no where impress.
-                    Okay, I'm never really cruel enough to be rating a restaurant 1.5, but this one deserved it. First and foremost, I want to express condescending shock and disappointment for the lack of courtesy and civility of the staff and management of this hotel. Linguistic/Community discrimination was rampant here. So, my friend and I, who're south Indians casually walk in, conversing in Kannada, our mother tongues, and were treated like insignificant creatures. We ordered 2 Rotis and a curry and waited for the longest 45 minutes of our lives. Two other tables of North Indian folk conversing in Hindi and Marathi respectively, who arrived after us were served much before us (For the record, I have a lot of North Indian friends and have nothing against them!) . We ran out of patience when the other two tables were ready for dessert and we were still waiting for the damn roti and curry. The bias display was pretty clear. We finally lost it and confronted the manager, who seemed to understand our predicament and offered a complimentary dish, which our bruised egos obviously repudiated. We left after giving a piece of mind to the management who're making money off Bangaloreans, but refuse to interact in the local language and treat customers differently, leaving the overdue Rotis untouched. I'm never going back in there and wouldn't recommend it. I was obviously too pissed to be taking notice of the ambience. Super disappointed!

-                                            Its a good restaurant for a calm and peaceful dine out!Although the ambience is not very wow.Food is still OK!U can drop in her once a while
-                                            The food is very ordinary. No special Rajasthani touch to it. The quantity is very less but pretty expensive for the ambience. Not recommended.
-                                            Never step into this restaurant, if you do it by mistake, never take buffee lunch or dinner, you will get butter milk as welcome drink, vade and bonda as starters, tastless panner curry, roti/kulcha, tasteless jira rice, plain rice, sambar and curds, you get stupid kesari bath as sweet and a spoon of ice cream in plastic disposible cup for RS.280, better go to any other restaurant have a full north indian meals, which is better.
-                                            Rajastani themed restaurant. They have many branches all over Bangalore. Buffet is available. Food was really bad. It was cold. The soup served was tasteless. Bad service.
-                                            Happened to visit this restaurant with my friends. We opted buffet dinner which had quite a decent menus.They don't serve soups instead they have a welcome drink which was very tasty. Starter and salads were quite good. In main course they had only one gravy and a daal. Which was quite disappointing. Phulkas were not smooth enough.  They really need to improve desert quality and menu.
-                                            The buffet is inr 330 pp all incl. But the quality is very mediocre, so is the variety. Daal baati didn't feel like one... I could eat, but at that price range, you can definitely hang in domino's and get a d cheese burst full in your mouth :p
-                                            This place is on the first floor near kathriguppe signal. Visited this place for lunch, they had a board that said spl buffet. There was nothing special about it. The usual north indian thali, only served buffet style, which cost us 340/head. I felt it wasn't worth that much. Food was ordinary. Service isn't very good (when u ask for salt, the server says it is on the other table madam please take it üòê )Food: 2.5/5Ambiance: 3/5Service: 2/5Price: 2/5
-                                            I tried the one located in Banshankari, third stage.. Food was amazing, my expression was it has to be Veg restaurant but it was not at all only Veg. Food was spicy and absolute pleasure to eat.
-                                            Have been staying in near by area for last 15 years. Dal Tadka inserted a pamphlet in the newspaper indicating the prices and the offers. Visited the place and to the astonishment there is a difference in the prices published on the pamphlet and the Menu in the Restaurant. On enquiring with the Manager, the reason given is the prices in the insertions in the newspaper is for home delivery. Totally confusing and misleading information by the management to pull crowd. Nowhere it is mentioned that its for home delivery. Tried reaching the owner but couldn't get his contact details. Don't want to comment of food as the primary objective of being transparent has been defeated.Would never advise my acquaintances to even try the place.
-                                            Too expensive and ordinary food...not so tasty...takes a lot of time for preparation and menu is least..yummy. I don't want to go again. Rice is somewhat like half cooked
-                                            A normal Rajasthani place. Not great but not too bad either . Malai loft ha was disappointing. Hara bara kebab and tomato soup was good. One time visit
-                                            Dangerous restaurant. Please dont visit. wonder how this place was almost full even after bad real bad food....after eating buffet there we all got sick. head spin, stomach upset, stomach infection all together. 6 of us went n all 6 of us r terribly sick. missed our college n offices......PLEASE DO NOT VISIT. FOR UR HEALTH SAKE.
-                                            Its a five minute walk from home, and yesterday I decided to go for dinner - a la carte. The place is neat and decently well maintained. Ordered ghee rice, dal fry and a sweet lassi. I wouldn't say the food is bad, but is prepared way too bland. Taste wise they are OK, and lassi was thick and tasty. Price is relatively high for the quantity of food which is served. Would recommend to people who prefer eating bland and non-spicy 100% vegetarian food., but otherwise, you can skip Dal Tadkaa.Ambiance - 3.5 / 5Service - 3.5 / 5Food - 3 / 5Value for money - 3 / 5
-                                             Waste of money Dinner was very bad , nothing seemed freshly cooked.Rice was very hard .On whole i had a worst experience.Only papad and jaljeera water is good
-                                            Couldn't give less than 1 This place literally sucks Worst place you can go to is this Food is like shit Ice cream was hard as rock Sucky ambience
-                                            I had buffet in Dal Tadka thrice. However I did not like the service over there. Few items like Churma, Dal-Bati, Khichdi and Cutlet are good and tasty.However few items like Paneer and Roti items were not that good. I will still say that food was fine. However service was very slow. They will tell you that they will deliver roti items on your table however they take long time to deliver it and that also cold. You have to remind them at least 5-6 times for that. Also when we told them 6th time, one of them got many naan and put 4-4 in each plate even when we told him to stop.
