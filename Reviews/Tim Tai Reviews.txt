-                                Kids love the place..Mandarin feast, mushroom satay, soya dumplings, Thai green curry, pad Thai..Hakka noodles are their favorites...the ambience is great and the service very friendly...                                                
-                                Great place. One of the most yummiest dishes I tasted here was the Tom Yum soup,it was simply too good. Som Tum Thai,a very different salad that I tried was delicious! Also,the chilly tofu and chilly garlic noodles were spicy and yum. Ambience is very colourful and lively! Overall experience was too good.                                                 
-                                Had bookmarked this place from a very long time and finally got to visit. Tried the barbecue chicken buns, a lamb gravy that was recommended, chilli garlic rice and a fried ice cream. Also had the ringer and Asian Mary. The drinks were excellent. The barbecue bun is highly recommended. The rice was average though and probably the only disappointment. The fried ice cream was good as well. On the whole a very good experience and highly recommended!                                                
-                                What a delightful place to have lunch. The only downside is that it's too crowded at times, reservation is recommended. Food comes in nice portions, enough for two. The ambience will take the cake anyway. The place is as immaculate as it gets. Choose less crowded hours and you'll never forget the place.                                                 
-                                Went to Tim Tai with a lot of expectations, had heard from friends this is a great place for Asian food. I must say I was a bit disappointed. The Shanghai Chicken Dimsum was the best of the lot, it was really yummy, non spicy for the kids, and they loved it. The crabmeat omelet was a disappointment, there was no salt, and the crab meat was not soft, may be it wasn't fresh. The egg fried rice was good. The dessert, apple fritters with blueberry compote and ice cream was bad. The fritters themselves were bland, the apple not sweet, and the batter used for the fritters not tasty. The blueberry compote didn't help, there was too little of it. The fritter needs to be sweeter. Somehow it didn't work for me. The place is fantastic though, well lit, beautifully decorated, and that tree in the middle is very well placed. Tim Tie deserves another try, will definitely go without kids and try the spicy stuff. That will decide.                                                                                   
-                The first thing that struck me about Tim Tai was the colourful ambience and the cheerful vibes that envelop the place. We had gone for a weekend lunch, which is conventionally considered to be a quiet affair at restaurants, but this place was just teeming with liveliness. The wonderful decor, done up in sober shades of yellow, peach and brown, must have been a catalyst. A tree stood right at the center of the establishment, which seemed to hold the place together. And on the side farthest from the entrance was a small area secluded by a glass wall, with a mini waterfall inside. Yes, a waterfall. Unfortunately, this area was out of service for some reason, and it was during my visit to the washroom that I came across this beauty.  As for our order, unluckily, I don't remember the names of the dishes that we had ordered (feel free to caption in comments the photos that I have uploaded), other than the basket of steamed momos. What I do remember is that all the items were quite satisfactory and filling, especially the momos. Moreover, I had already fallen in love with the place, and the preparations would have had to be horribly bad to change my mind.   Tim Tai definitely deserves a visit, as much for the interiors as for the food. And don't forget to order their steamed momos if you do make it there.

-                                A pleasant setting and smiling faces welcome you to this place .As a lover of Asian food it pretty much satisfy my hunger however wish they had a slightly more elaborate spread.                                                
-                                First thing one notices on entering the place is the colourful ambience. Its all very soothing to eye in its pink, green and yellow. We were a group of 5 with 3 females and especially the females were in awe of the ambience. To start it off, we ordered a dimsum platter. There were only 8 pieces which were kind of less for 5 of us. So we ended up sharing. I could only taste 2 out of 4 types and liked one of them due to its spicy taste. I am not good at remembering chinese dishes but we ordered a noodles, a rice and 2 veg dishes. All i can at a broad level was that the food was amazing. Things like lotus stem were a part of veggies which I have very rarely seen. All in all, a good dinner outing.                                                
-                                This place has a great ambience along  with the food. Ordered red curry and pad Thai. I can definitely say that red curry was one of the best I have tasted. Pad Thai was also good. Ordered fried ice cream for desert and that also didn't disappoint. It had a green tea flavour due to which it had a unique taste. Service was okay. Lovely place to hangout with friends and family.                                                
-                                The vibrant pink n yellow decor gave me a happy feeling as I entered Tim Tai! There is sufficient seating and the setup doesn't make it seem over crowded at all. The place for Thai and Chinese cuisines, Tim Tai doesn't disappoint. Flavours are far more authentic than the usual Indianized Chinese that we find in most places. Definitely recommended.                                                
-                    This was one place that I wanted to go to for a very long time. So friends and us came here for Sunday lunch. My first impression- absolutely lovely decor. Whoever did the decor of the restaurant has wonderful taste. We arrived and were seated immediately... Since there were six of us we ordered for the following  Drinks- cinnamon and orange iced tea, Mandarin feast, Asian Mary and one Lady love.  Starters- spicy Soya and basil dimsum, Thai styled grilled chicken with green apple Som Tam, Lotus stem with honey chilli and a Tom yum soup  Main course- Thai red curry, Burmese curry with plain rice, phad Thai noodles and lamb and leeks with black pepper sauce.  We all loved our drinks except for the Mandarin drink everything else was fresh and flavourful. Asian Mary was absolutely perfect in terms of flavour. Right mix of basil, Tabasco and guava. The soup was clear and had lots of vegetables with a strong hint of lemon grass. Light on the tummy. We enjoyed all the starters- the marination on the chicken was absolutely perfect and it looked as if it had penetrated the chicken completely. Wasnt too charred too. Served with the green apple the sweet and sour balance of flavours was spot on. I have to say the Lotus stem surprised us all. Fried and coated in honey chilli sauce it was perfect. Dimsums were moist. Slightly chilly for me but didn't lack any flavours. -                        This was one place that I wanted to go to for a very long time.

-                                            Went to Tim Tai for lunch twice and was impressed both times.  The Shanghai noodles for vegetarians is a must to try!  Like the way the staff handle the traffic of people.   Going back soon.                                                             
-                                            A very attractive entrance you won't miss seeing this place if you have visited the food street of KoramangalaA beautiful ambiance and Asian cuisineWe started with the Chinese baby corn signature starter. Some dim sim which was served with a spicy red sauce. Loved it.Spring rolls became our main course as we were too full to go for the traditional main course.The brownie dessert was a good and to our Asian meal here. The staff was very helpful. Not crowded on weekdays. Beautiful ambiance to top the experience.                                                                                                           
-                                            If you have love for dimsums, this place is for you guys. We tried their steamed dimsums which were very yum. But we wanted to try their deep fried dimsums too, which turned out to be very bad. Dint like it at all. This place is quite big and is a family restaurant. I loved their decor it was quite cool.                                                            
-                                            Such a pretty and quirky decor. It was the first thing that caught my eye! Food was great and pocket friendly. Service good too. A must visit if looking for a casual asian dinner in the Koramangala area.                                                            
-                    Tuesday evening at 9pm Tim Tai had made its mark as one of the good restaurants which was here to stay in the sea of restaurants in that area. I visited this place for the first time and had high expectations from it. Me and my friend were seated almost centrally in the restaurant where they have an indoor tree feature. The ambiance was nice and our waiter was courteous. We placed the order for vegetarian Satay platter and nasi goreng. For the beverage we went with mandarin feast and lemon grass. The drinks didn't take much time to come and tasted good. We loved the flavour that was infused and the fact that it was not brain freezingly cold or diluted. The starter arrived soon and looked heavenly. We loved the peanut sauce that came with it. They nailed the Satay unlike other places which just serve meat or veggies on a skewer. The flavour was authentic and the dish was presented well. The main course was the star of the show. Nasi goreng which literally translates to fried rice was upscaled and brought back memories of Indonesia. The fried garlic and onions added to the taste. We contemplated about having dessert but decided to have more food. We went ahead and ordered Indonesian bamee noodles. The flavour was very similar to the rice and we realized we should have ordered something else but we can save that for next time. This place has amazing food and good service. Recommended for days you crave for south East Asian cuisine.

-                                            Cool ambience. Valet parking available. Went here with a bunch of colleagues to taste the Thai cuisine. Had dimsum , dumplings, fried rice and other few dishes which I do not remember exactly. But each dish had a unique taste which awakened some of the hidden senses inside of me. Dishes were cooked to perfection. Service was prompt. Would definitely return.                                                             
-                                            Sometimes Sunday afternoon can bring up the tricky question - where do we eat? Being new to namma Bengaluru a close relative suggested - just drive down to Koramangala and decide after reaching there.  Turned out to be a good plan. Finally decided on this restaurant - no regrets.  Sunday afternoon very crowded. Had to wait for sometime but worth it. We had chicken satay, dimsum platter, raw mango salad as starters and khao pahd chicken,  nasi goreng chicken, Thai mussaman curry, lamb and bamboo shoots with black bean sauce as the main course.  Big appetite one would say. But no there were four adults and two children. So it was a little more than enough.  Food was very well prepared and staff was very courteous.  Will certainly visit again to try something different.                                                               
-                                            I came to Bangalore from Delhi for a bakery course and someone There recommended this place to me as I was craving for some real good Chinese food and the place did not disappoint me at all  We ordered soup, appetizers and some main course for takeaway  I ordered hot n sour which had well balanced flavours and was up to the mark  In starters we ordered apricot glazed cauliflower which so crisp with right amount of sauce over it and spicy soya dimsums and spring rolls which were again tasteful and succeeded to satisfy my taste buds  For main course we had green Thai curry vd rice and chili garlic noodles  Overall everything was pretty good in taste and fairly priced  The ambience is good too but was crowded a bit cos of which the service was a bit slow even though when we had a table reservation done in advance  But still if you are served good food at the end you neglect the small things  👍 -                     Oh I just loved this place all over again. Visited here as a part of the Dinnerfest lunch and boy it was a treat!  The restaurant was ready with our table when we arrived and the service was swift.  We started off with Tim Tai chilly chicken and the pan grilled fish. The chilly chicken was out of this world, crunchy on the outside and juicy succelent on the inside. Crunchy peanuts and red chilly made it lip smacking.The pan grilled fish was equally good, flavoured with lemon grass cooked to perfection. We were stuffed!!  For main course we could not order one each@ as the starters had got us full, however we sampled Tim tai special chilli corriander noodles with Kung pao chicken. Both were extremely well prepared with generous portions.  -                         Oh I just loved this place all over again. Visited here as a part of the Dinnerfest lunch and boy it was a treat!

We started with a Non-Veg Dimsum Platter with a Raspberry Iced Tea. The dimsum platter came with 4 chicken, 2 lamb, and 2 prawn dimsums - out of which the lamb and shanghai chicken dimsums were the best. Our entrees Roasted Chilli and Basil Fish along with Indonesian Bamee Goreng Noodles. To our surprise, instead of a stir fried, it was a actually a crispy fried fillets stirred with vegetables in a chilli and basil sauce - giving it a nice crispy, spicy flavour. The noodles had typical a indonesian flavour of sambal.  On small note to the restaurant management, the restrooms were extremely dirty and water was all over the floor. This can be a huge turn off.                                                            
-                                            So I thought real hard to try and find out faults with the lunch I had over here. Aaaaand I just couldn't come up with anything! Why not the perfect score ? Cause I feel there's always scope for improvement. Also cause the spinach gau dimsums weren't as impressive as the rest of the dishes severed. (Not that it was bad in anyway) So yeah the price may be a little on the higher side but its worth every penny. So stop scrolling through the rest of the reviews and reserve a table (highly recommended).

-                    Tim Tai ,as the clever name suggests is a chic restaurant in Kormangala serving Thai, South east Asian and Asian fusion dishes. They have a modern casual atmosphere with an upscale Asian look. The tree inside the restaurant really stands out for me.  The ambience on its own is a major selling point and makes it an ideal place to hang out .  Ordered the Tom Kha soup, seafood soup with a coconut milk broth,galangal and Thai basil. Taste wise it was good and enough for two people however the soup was way too thick for a Thai soup. The body should have been lighter. Tried the chicken satay which was perfectly cooked,moist on the inside with a delicious peanut sauce,however a bit too salty for my taste. A little less salt and it would have been a perfect dish. However the star of the night was the duck rolls. Peking style roasted duck with cucumber and scallions and an unnecessary dipping sauce which didn't add to the dish. The duck was very well seasoned and well cooked,probably among the best duck rolls I had. Strongly recommended. The service got off to a bumpy start as despite it being a not so busy weeknight our table was unattended for a while ,however the dishes came out quickly, though the pacing could have been better. That being said the staff were very warm and welcoming  I would go back and try more dishes.

-                    Tim Tai ,as the clever name suggests is a chic restaurant in Kormangala serving Thai, South east Asian and Asian fusion dishes. They have a modern casual atmosphere with an upscale Asian look. The tree inside the restaurant really stands out for me.  The ambience on its own is a major selling point and makes it an ideal place to hang out .  Ordered the Tom Kha soup, seafood soup with a coconut milk broth,galangal and Thai basil. Taste wise it was good and enough for two people however the soup was way too thick for a Thai soup. The body should have been lighter. Tried the chicken satay which was perfectly cooked,moist on the inside with a delicious peanut sauce,however a bit too salty for my taste. A little less salt and it would have been a perfect dish. However the star of the night was the duck rolls. Peking style roasted duck with cucumber and scallions and an unnecessary dipping sauce which didn't add to the dish. The duck was very well seasoned and well cooked,probably among the best duck rolls I had. Strongly recommended. The service got off to a bumpy start as despite it being a not so busy weeknight our table was unattended for a while ,however the dishes came out quickly, though the pacing could have been better. That being said the staff were very warm and welcoming  I would go back and try more dishes.

-                                            Tim Tia is an Asian Fusion place in Koramangala and based on its Zomato ratings, our dining experience total matched our expectations. We started with a Non-Veg Dimsum Platter with a Raspberry Iced Tea. The dimsum platter came with 4 chicken, 2 lamb, and 2 prawn dimsums - out of which the lamb and shanghai chicken dimsums were the best. Our entrees Roasted Chilli and Basil Fish along with Indonesian Bamee Goreng Noodles. To our surprise, instead of a stir fried, it was a actually a crispy fried fillets stirred with vegetables in a chilli and basil sauce - giving it a nice crispy, spicy flavour. The noodles had typical a indonesian flavour of sambal.  On small note to the restaurant management, the restrooms were extremely dirty and water was all over the floor. This can be a huge turn off.                                                            
-                                            So I thought real hard to try and find out faults with the lunch I had over here. Aaaaand I just couldn't come up with anything! Why not the perfect score ? Cause I feel there's always scope for improvement. Also cause the spinach gau dimsums weren't as impressive as the rest of the dishes severed. (Not that it was bad in anyway) So yeah the price may be a little on the higher side but its worth every penny. So stop scrolling through the rest of the reviews and reserve a table (highly recommended).
