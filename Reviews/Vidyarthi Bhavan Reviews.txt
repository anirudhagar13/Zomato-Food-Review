-                                You genuinely feel gratitude towards the founders of a food space the moment you realize they carry the same puritan beliefs you do. This was a sum up of my experience at vidyarthi bhavan. The line outside no thanks to Karnataka rajya Otsava was huge. Took us 40 mins to get a place. The food however more than compensated. The masala dose has a mild south Indian aalo mix with a really thick almost bread like dose made in pure butter. The flavor the comes from blending out of the world ingredients is just insane. The upma was so good that a non upma eater like me polished the entire plate. Special mention for their coconut chutney which is on the spicy side, but goes well with the food. Will definitely go here on those rare occasions that I crave South Indian veg food.
-                Vidyarthi Bhavan came into existence somewhere in the 1940s i.e., even before my parents were born! You can imagine how much historical value it has in terms of culinary achievements in this city.This place has had very little changes in terms of the way it looks. They have tried to retain it's old charm.We reached here exactly at 7am and the place was full already. There were people leaving the place after finishing their breakfast. And we had to wait for a good 20 minutes before we got seats for ourselves. You cannot expect a table to yourself and your partner/ family. You have to share your table with a total stranger sometimes, like we had to.We wanted to taste everything this place had to offer but it was only 2 of us. So, we tried what this place is known for since it's inception the 'dosey'.The hot and crispy dosas had our mouths watering even before we ordered. We decided on ordering sagu dosey, masala dosa, vada, poori sagu and coffee. Another good 20 minutes before the dosey came. Chutney took another 3 minutes. Coffee didn't come at all, so we just ignored it. By this, you should know that you have to be really very patient. There are too many people and it might take quite some time for your orders to reach your table. The dosey is comparatively smaller in radius and if you want sambar, you need to ask for it. It's not given along with it by default, like in other South Indian Hotels. I'd say, If you're a Bangalorean and you haven't been here, it's time you do. If you're not from the city, then you should certainly visit here before you move elsewhere.

-                                Iconic Bangalore place they say - a very satisfying Diwali breakfast later, I have to fully agree! Was a half hour wait - we whiled it away delightfully shopping for this and that in the puja/ flower/ fruit market around.They have a system - the wait staff has walky talkies! All people in one party have to be seated one side of the room etc. But has an awesome ambience - olde world but v charming .And the food!!! Ooh Lala! The khara baath - was to die for! The idli vada sambar nice, and the masala dosa - with red rice, full of ghee, but sooo yummy!! Finger licking good!
-                                This restaurant has a really old feel to it. The building has that unique charm. The inexpensive food served here is good and I loved the idly sambar. Many people consider the dosa served here to be the best but I felt that it was overated and didn't taste as good as the adiga's dosa. One time visit would do.
-                                The name it has made for itself made me want to give this a try though I am not a big fan of masala dosas. I wasn't disappointed as the piping hot dosas are both crisp and soft at the same time, with they yummy green chutney around it . The rava vada was something I tried for the first time and was left craving for more . The management is something that is really commendable, they have adapted to modern technology like using a walky - talky to communicate the number of seats available ,the billing and service are quick too . There is a mandatory waiting period which cannot be determined, but it's worth it . The ambience is maintained to evoke nostalgia to native Bangaloreans
-                                Best dosa I have ever had in my entire life... It's been very long since I visited this place... Near to Gandhi bazar... And the way they serve the food toh wah...!! Mouth watering... Cheers!!
-                                Why 5, why 4.5, why even 3.5 ??We visited this place during weekends as we are heading towards Avalabetta. We heard that this is the place where you will find breakfast early in the morning. We thought to give it a try and went almost 15km opposite of Avalabetta journey. To my surprise I don't feel this place as good as they say about it as Legendary.  We waited for almost 20min for 4 masala dosa's to get served to us. The potato masala was overcooked and the batter for masala dosa is of Ragi and not Rice. We also ordered Kharabhat which was perfectly cooked. This is a very small place in the heart of basavanagudi and you will find it crowded between 6:30am till 10am.

-                Go there only if you are patient enough to wait, we waited for more than an hour just to get a table for two. We had heard a lot about this place, so thought of giving it a try. Once you are inside, you get this very traditional feeling and you kind of get a positive vibe. Their menu is also limited. So we ordered for masala dosa, kesari bath and filter coffee. They gave us the kesari bath first, I had a nice bright yellow colour to it. A bit wobbly, not too sweet, just perfect, I'm not a big fan of dry fruits, so I was happy with this one as it only had kismis in it. The masala dosa took some time to reach our table. They just serve the dosa first and then comes the chutney. One thing that we observed was that they don't serve sambar with dosa, i wonder why. The dosa was thick and crisp. To be honest, I didn't feel this was worth waiting for hours. The potato masala inside was cooked properly and wasn't hard. Talking about the filter coffee, I love coffee, specially filter coffee and I would like to say that I've had better filter coffee than this one. On the whole, it was a very different experience. I would like to give the-Food - 3/5Ambience - 3/5Service - 4/5

-                                            I have been here couple of times. The idlies are nice, the masala dosa is ok. The sambhar was watery, not thick as I expected, and as other darshinis provide. Chutney is the only thing I can eat here. I am not sure if the management is the same or has changed, but I think their food standards are not upto the mark, so is the coffee.
-                                            Tucked away in the crowded gandhibazar, this legendary place is sure to be visited if you are in bangalore. Yes, of course there will be huge waiting times and if you are lucky you will get a seat quickly. You may have to share your table with other people. Rava vada and masala dose are upon you. You attack them with all your strength, chutney will be poured onto your plate whenever you ask for it. You come out feeling happy, burping with joy.
-                                            The perfect place to be for every dosa lover in Bangalore. These people have made a name for serving one of the best dosas in town. Must try their Masala dosa and Sagu masala dosa. Their Rava vada aint bad either. The servers are known for they do and they have been doing since a lot of years. this is place is crowded at anytime of the day when it is open, so get in as soon as it opens to avoid longer wait times.Ambiance: 3/5Food: 4.5/5Staff: 4/5Value for money: 4.5/5
-                                            The place still has not been renovated and that adds the feel of old bangalore...awesome dosa ..crispy...and the coffee is too good...worth waiting
-                                            Love this place for their dosas and coffee.The dosas just melts in your mouth and suddenly you feel like you have become a glutton and feel like gobbling up of dosas.their chutney too is very good.You'll have to wait more than 30 min for your benne dosa but you'll finish the dosas in 3 min!!! It's worth the wait and very pocket friendly. Best place to have breakfast or occasionally lunch as well.must visit place for their benne dosas.
-                                            I hate myself for not visiting this small yet legendary dosa joint even though its been 3 years of living in Bangalore. So woke up early one fine Saturday morning travelled for 14 kms and landed up here. We had poori sago, masala dosa, Kesari bath, and coffee.Everything was good, a special mention to their thick yet crispy dosa and sweet kesari bath drenched in ghee. Loved it.
-                                            Had been here on sunday morning for breakfast. We waited for around 30 - 40mins to get a table, but it was worth the wait.  Had ordered masala dosa,  saagu masala dosa,  kesri bath,  poori sagu,  idly,  vada and tea.  They serve in traditional way,  wearing lungis with many plates in hand. Masala dosa is must try when you are here.
-                                            VB is the place to be in when in B Gudi. After a waiting for a table for about 20 minutes, lopping dosas and stuff is so heavenly. Way to go VB
-                                            I have lost count of the number of times I have visited this place. For all the Non resident Bangaloreans, VB as it's often referred to is a must visit whenever they are visiting the city. The ghee dripping Masala dosas, the sight of dollops of butter melting on the dosa and their signature style chutney threatening to fall off your plate..what an awesome photo memory it is! Must try is the chow chow bath, Maddur vada and of course Masala Dosa. If you are in the Gandhi Bazaar, Basavanagudi area, don't miss this placeIt's not a huge place so go there early if you want to sit and eatFood: 4service: 4ambience: 3
-                                            No wonder this place is legendary.. What an experience, what a feeling.. In my bucket list for quite some time, I finally got to visit this gem of a place with my foodie friends and oh la la, am thrilled to say the list. Dosa was exceptional and so was Vada idly. Service exceptional and super efficient.. Just loved it, worth traveling to the city to visit this old gem
-                                            How did I just miss this outlet updating??Have been a regular over here over the last 15 years easily and this eatery is easily over 50 years old...Even dignitaries like ex-Chief ministers like S .M .Krishna,Yeduyurappa and other important people come here.The place resembles a war-torn like establishment with the old type of tables and benches...TASTE-U R THE BOSSKnown for its crispy masala dosa with that heavenly chutney,you will easily end up eating 2 dosas...Finish it off with a strong filter coffee..Service is excellent for the high crowds they handle..Breakfast for 2 costs Rs 200/- Limited 2 wheeler parking...-                                            What is just another old dosa joint for many, nostalgia for old Bangaloreans was a taste of heritage for me when I visited Vidyarthi Bhavan recently. When I stepped in through the door that has seen many a stalwart pass through, I was overwhelmed. I realised I was not biting into the crispy buttery benne dosa but Bangalore's cultural heritage. Visit not only for the food but the total experience of being there...                                                                ...
-                                            The thick dosas made with ghee. The super soft khara bath. The amazingly ghee loaded kesari bath and wash it all down with a hot tumbler of super strong filter coffee. I want to give more stars here!!
-                                            Awesome place.    No wonder y they hold the title of one of the  best dosas in Bangalore... Legacy shows in there food and the care they take to give that kinda quality... Ppl love this place,  I've been there like soo many times but every time I had to wait for my seating , such is the popularity of this legendary place .. If u ever get bored of Dosa here then there r equally gud other stuffs in the menu ... I'm already drooling thinking abt  the Dosa..
-                                            Vidyarthi Bhavan is one of the legendary restaurants in South Bangalore and well known for their own style of Masala Dosa. The Masala dosa which we get here is unique and I am sure, you don’t find it anywhere in the town. Everyone has their own mixed feelings about the taste of Dosa in Vidyarthi Bhavan. As per my prospective they are still best.                                                                ...
-                                            I'll keep it short and simple.What's going for it - the dosa, the kharabhat and the kesaribath.What's not - Idli, vada, the long wait time.Their masala dosa is the only item which sets this place apart. The spicy masala and buttery crispy dosa makes for a great meal. Unfortunately, most of the other items are barely better than your average darshini. The kharabath and kesaribath are decent while the idli and vada are just about average. Worth a visit for the masala dosa.-                                            #Blrbwalks………This time the food trip started early with us foodies meeting up to try two legendary places of Bangalore which still gives the essence of the old times (not in the smell thankfully &gt;:-) ). The first one was a pleasure since had never been there before and going back the Vidhyarti Bhavan after 7 long years was a real trip !                                                                ...
-                                            Finally got a chance to have breakfast on a Sunday morning amidst a huge crowd waiting to enter this legendary restaurant.The interiors boasts sketches a wide range of achievers in different field in Karnataka which I loved.Coming to the food had masala dosa it was good but I couldn't help comparing to the ones we get in ctr and it definitely not as good as the latter one.Have to try other dishes when I happen to go next time.
-                    After staying in Bangalore for 8 year's, I finally got a chance to come to Vidyarthi Bhavan.Saturday we made plans and on Sunday morning at 8.15 we reached Vidyarthi Bhavan. I was already packed and there where a lot of people standing outside as well. I gave my name and it took almost 20-30 mins for us to get a place to sit.After reading some reviews on Zomato ordered Vada, Masala Dosa and Tea. It hardly took 2 mins for us to get Vada dipped in Sambhar and the taste was okay. After finishing our Vada's we waited for 10 mins to finally get our hands on the famous Masala Dosa which Vidyarthi Bhavan is known for. My wife's Dosa was better than mine as mine was all burned. I have added some pictures for all. The Chutney what comes with the food is good. I tried my wife's Dosa to find out how good the taste was but I felt the taste was average. My wife as well felt the same. Finally we had our Tea and left the place.I still have some hope and may be when I have time, I will try this place again.Ambience 4/5-                        After staying in Bangalore for 8 year's, I finally got a chance to come to Vidyarthi Bhavan.Saturday we made plans and on Sunday morning at 8.15 we reached Vidyarthi Bhavan.

-                                            Been there on weekdays to avoid the crowd but ended up waiting there for 10-15 mins. An eatery , which started as a canteen, with reasonable  prices and sharing and retro seating arrangement for around 30-35 people. Clay roof tiles and various photos of famous personalities adorn the walls.Service was slow but It's a feast to watch the staff walk out of the kitchen balancing plates of dosa. I ordered idlli-vada, masala dosa, poori-sagu, kesari bath and of-course filtter coffee. Dosa was crispy but little overcooked. Vada was crispy but idlli was not soft and fluffy.  Kesari bath and coffee was  OK. It might have a great history but it didn't live up to expectation and hype.
