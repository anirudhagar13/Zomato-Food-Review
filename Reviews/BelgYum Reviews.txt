-                                After a long long time, I am giving some place as 5 rating! But believe me it's worth it! I just haven't ate waffles like there's! Atleast not in India! Crispy, fresh, perfectly sweet and awesome toping. Great place specially for people having sweet tooth.
-                                Had one of their famous Nutella Waffles... I might be over my head to say thay I expected more from them after reading such good reviews... All I will say that I have had better waffles... But many people like them so you can definitely try them... Try with Ice Cream....
-                                There is no seating area as such. My friends and I had the Chocolate Belge waffle, standing in the crowded corridor. Waffles were pretty salty in comparison to what I have tried in some cafes in the city.
-                                Best #waffles in the town. Wow, just lip smacking. Finest place to finish your evening with dessert in pheonix mall. They make it beautifully. Reasonable price according to quality. It is a shop/counter which has 6-7 chairs. Overall loved it.
-                                Loved it ...best waffles eaten ever...Maple and icecreams is the best combination ever....-                                This is a small place in Phoenix but has the best waffles in town. It is a small outlet to getting a place to sit is a bit tough. Maybe they can increase the size of the outlet.
-                                Waffles lovers must try this place ! Fresh baked waffles and the hot melted sauce with sugar icing ! Perfect after a meal. Well this is a small place so you cannot expect to get a place to sit there and have your waffle, rather you can grab n go!
-                                This outlet at Phoenix mall is tiny, but it's the best waffles around. The presentation of the waffle is very much appreciated. Waffles lovers will relish, but wish the menu had more options. We are very limited to a few and the seasonal fruits sometimes not available.In all you may try this and enjoy.
-                                My all time favourite waffle place, number one among what so all other brands available in market. I am a very frequent visitor and I love visiting this place again and again.. everything is topnotch, customer service, waffles and the place too.
-                                After my first visit to this place i have become a waffle lover. Till now I visited this place many times and have tried almost all the combination of waffles with different toppings and my fav ones are Go Banana with Caramel Sauce and Go Nuts with Ice-cream.
-                                            In love with this place! I usually am not a big fan of waffles but they give amazing ones!. We tried the chocolate truffles one . It was a crunchy waffle with a lot of icing sugar and chocolate spread they then poured ice cream and whipped cream on it and hot chocolate sauce . It was an amazing dish z I plan to go here every weekend
-                                            The waffles were great and it's a really nice outlet to have a casual talk and indulge into your sweet cravings. I would recommend it to people who would love to try this dessert.
-                                            It goes by its name. The waffles are absolute yum. I tried the Nut Cracker and it was worth it. Waffles with cream in top with nuts. Would love to try the other flavors. Great place.
-                                            Updated : The Maple syrup and banana combination is also amazing. Its light, crispy and totally worth trying ********************************* -                                            The best place for waffles ! I always ensure that I stop by Belgyum every time I drop in at Phoenix. I have been here a lot number of times. Though I have always wanted to try the different flavors they offer, I end up getting the nutcase every single time. I'm totally in love with nutcase. So, that gives me an excellent excuse to get back there every time, in the hope to try a different combination the next time as well as their shakes.Kudos to the belgyum team :) -                                            The name is definitely innovative and if you are a waffle lover like me, this place is going to be on your list. However, personally for me, it didn't live up to the hype. I don't really mind the limited number of options in waffles n the toppings but the taste was quite ordinary. I asked for the chocolate topping and it overpowered the waffle. All I could taste was an overload of chocolate sauce with not so tasty bits of waffle! I have had much better. I am not ruling out the place. Would probably try again. Love the concept but they need to work on the dish itself and the proportion of the toppings.
-                                            I just love their waffles. üòçWhenever I visit phoenix, I always end up having their waffle go banana with nutella and vanilla ice cream, it's so wow.I wish they had their outlet here in Mumbai as well.-                                            Tried 1st time... But simply loved it.Will visit to try different options from menu.Had Nutella waffle that was really good... Next time will go with toppings ;)-                                            This place serves tastiest waffles i have ever eaten. Their waffles are tasty and crispy and just melts in your mouth. Nuttela waffles are just heavenly and a must try
-                                            Undoubtedly this place serves one of the best waffles in the city.Made fresh and served fresh.Little Crispy and crunchy.-                                            I am a waffles fan and in the food court of Phoenix mall this was the only interesting food stall.as all others are available in Orion and mantri mall. There was quite a lot of rush and there were quite a few combinations to choose from. You have different sauces to choose from like maple, nutella, chocolate, blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, etc. Then you have different toppings like nuts, fruits, etc. After thinking long and hard I decided to try winter surprise which was waffle with powder sugar, strawberry sauce and whipped cream. The waffle was baked well and tasted really good with strawberry sauce and whipped cream. Prices are reasonable. Hope it opens in other malls as well!
-                                            The bestest place to have the yummiest waffles!!Customize and be creative with your waffles or go with what's listed on the menu..you will love it either ways!The waffles are fresh and well made and the toppings and sauces are perfect..try everything you can on their menu and you will be surprised how each new preparation delights you every time :)-                                            I sneaked in to this place while my wife was busy shopping. This place has the highest rating in Whitefield and now was the real test of zomato rating system..:)There were quite a lot of people and it took a while for my number to arrive.  Since I was alone, I ordered only 1 Banana Nutella waffle. It was hot and nice. The taste was yum and left me wanting for 1 more.-                                            Not sure why this place is so crazily highly rated. It's just a solid waffle place, so-so value for money. Should offer more options, like flavored waffles (chocolate, chocolate chip, could also have pumpkin, peanut butter, etc.). Pretty average range of toppings too.
-                                            Nice waffles, but not the best I've had in Bangalore. Love the pun in the name, though. Nutella waffles with ice cream and chocolate sauce for the win! The whipped cream tastes milky, so I didn't like it.
-                                            Initially when I went here .... I was literally confused. Is this waffle is enough of me ? or will it be able to fill my stomach? leave stomach will it be good in taste or worth spending single Penny over it? 15mins later my all Questions were answered. -                    Belgyum's like those umpteen flats and houses with their gates and parking areas encroaching upon the road that go in front. There was a reason the space was built the way it was, but these morons conveniently choose to extend their briefs, quite literally. So don't be surprised when you see people hustling and busting in front of Belgyum - that's where people stuff their faces with the ice cream laden waffles, besides hopping left and right to make way for the traffic passing through. Who says sorry when the ice cream rubs on to that rushing shirt is a matter for another day. You could have ignored all of this in a mall like Phoenix, where only one lift works on weekdays despite people queueing up, had the food been great. Ordinary ice creams on a waffle and not in it, could have probably worked at half the price at which they're dishing it out; it certainly didn't impress any of us. All we do now, is take the bypass route to Berry'd Alive or Creame and Fudge - dessert joints that score heads and shoulders above this one and have seating that doesn't spill over intentionally.

-                                            Tried Nut Case and Coffee. They prepare waffle upfront. Taste was good. They have limited seating arrangement, ambiance is good. Reasonably priced.
