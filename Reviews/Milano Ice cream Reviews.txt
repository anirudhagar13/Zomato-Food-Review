-                                            Milano stands out among all the other ice cream parlour in Bangalore. They have amazing ice cream, the only problem here is they don't have parking. We had 4 different flavours of ice cream which were all amazing in taste. We've also tried their Ice cream cake slice and this too is the best ever. This is my first visit to Milano and I'm definitely recommending this place to all the ice cream lovers and I'm definitely coming back for more.                                                            
-                                            Perfect in all ways. This place is the shizzzzz ! I have such cravings for their flavours that I don't mind travelling close to 20 kms one way when my heart desires a little spirulina or their rum and apple sorbet. Both their gelatos and sorbets are top notch.  And the flavours !! Some of the best I have had in my life. Very different from standard flavours you get elsewhere. Some flavours will make you wonder how can those tastes even be combined together but these are geniuses at work, the same people who are involved in Fort Kochi. I havnt tried their crepes or sundaes but would like to do that soon.                                                             
-                                            AmazingThe entire concept of giving 3 ice creams is superbIt's filling and you get all the flavours you like.Quite a good place situated in the heart of the city.Simple, tasty and unique flavours.The smoothness of the gelato is to die for !‚ù§Ô∏è                                                            
-                                            Being a die hard icecream fan, went to milano to tick if off my list. Tried the Chocolate sundae. Top notch gelato ,like to think the best I have tasted in Bangalore. This place deserves a 5/5 . But out of the short menu, they did not have some items that I would have liked to try on my one visit. After all, travelling across the town is a lot of pain :) MUST Try for ice cream / dessert lovers. ** update ** Went a second time , and this time tried the Truffle Icecream. It was exceptional , quite deservedly modified my rating to 5. The quantity in this concoction was super filling and the gelato was exceptional. 2 flavours of ice cream with Cocoa dust on it ! wah wah !                                                            
-                                            I have been here around 8+ times already. My go to place for ice cream. My favorite flavors are anything with berries, orange and Mascarpone cheese. The price is very decent for the portion. A 100 gm cup can be mixed with 2 flavors.                                                            
-                                            Goodness me! I just tasted the best ice cream in town yesterday. I went here seeing the rating on zomato and i wasnt let down a bit. The ambiance is just what is required for an ice cream parlor. I had the two scoops in the beginning which urged me to have two more. Will try their Crepe, Sundaes and Lollypop next time. Pricing is worth the buck. Management and staff are excellentAmbiance: 5/5Food: 4.5/5Staff: 4.5/5Value for money: 4.5/5                                                            
-                                            Having gelato for the first time.. This place is away from the major Indiranagar area.. Visited this place with bro and we took the sugar coated cones with 2 scoops.. my brother took the fruity flavors while I chose the chocolate flavors.. These were good and different from the ice creams elsewhere.. would definitely recommend this place üòä                                                            
-                                            It was a great pleasure to get introduced to this place And there are hell lot of flavours here.  I was excited to see jasmine flavored ice-cream.  So decided to try it.  Well... it tastes exactly as the fragrance of the flower.lolWild berries was too sour and wasnt my type. Milk and hazelnut was amazing and so was truffles. Nice place for ice-cream lovers.                                                            
-                                            Excellent place for ice cream,  Its so fresh and good.... it's beyond words. I definitely recommend this place to all ice cream lovers...  A must go place. I have tried almost all flavors here and  to tell the truth I have never been disappointed.  Everyday you can find some new flavors there....                                                             
-                    Voila! This is my last review during my last stay in Bangalore. And while writing this, my heart feels a bit heavy as I felt while bidding farewell to my partner in Bangalore. Hence, this review will always reserve a special place in my heart. As it was the last review, we both decided to celebrate with the family.I was wondering such high ratings would serve extremely high quality ice creams and was disappointed at no point.We had taken a sample platter consisiting of four scoops of different flavours of your choice, freshly whipped cream and hot chocolate sauce. We chose -Extra White (felt like eating a white chocolate ice cream.)Wildberries (rich with flavours of berries, this is more of a sorbet, very refreshing.)Tiramisu (had hints of coffee, which is more dominant in a tiramisu icecream, but what special is that you could also taste the mascarpone cream cheese, simply loved it!)Orange Cheesecake Gelato (a new kind of ice cream, very different flavour, all of us liked it.)Stomach was full but not to our heart's content. So, we took another two scoops in separate cups. They serve 100gms in one cup, you can also divide it into two flavours 50gms each. I think the amount is pretty amazing for a cup. As my mother insisted to take a cup of her favourite Extra White ice cream, we went for one cup of it and another cup of Chocolate Truffle. Both the flavours were insteresting and we loved them.The portions are commendable, pricing is perfect with no added taxes and the flavours seem great with the freshly churned rich cream. Sitting area and the decor consists of everything white, that would soothe your eyes definitely. This place is highly recommended for trying out the high quality ice creams and I can guarantee that you would have a lovely time with your loved ones. Happy Dining! :)

-                                            It's a gem for ice-cream. Thanks to zomato we found this place in indranagar.We tried many of their ice-creams. They all were great, the lemon flavour and sweet-meat were the two, which we liked the most.We tired their crepe too, however, it wasn't that great.I would again go here especially to have their lemon flavoured ice-cream.                                                            
-                                            Cozy lil corner to savor Italian crafted Ice creams . Try their French crepes n banana split sundaes. However their truffle ice cream is good too :)                                                            
-                                            Absolute Value for Money and Great Taste.We can see few places a scope of Ice cream for INR 50, you have to take a combo of 2 scopes so minimum becomes INR 100, still worth the money.We tried Tiramisu, some whisky flavor and multiple rounds of chocolate and truffles.Creamy and full bodied - we loved it.They also have sundaes and crepes. May be next time. Will visit again.                                                            
-                                            This place serves THE BEST gelatos! They have the creamiest, greatest flavours. My favourite is the wine-based cr√®me br√ªl√©e ‚ù§Ô∏è Can't get enough of these gelatos. And they're so easy on the wallet. Truly value for money. Highly recommended.                                                             
-                                            This place has the most amazing gelato in Bangalore. Lots of variety, cheerful ambiance, good service and top class quality! All this at reasonable price.                                                             
-                                            Looking for a gelato parlour that has decent flavours and easy on your pocket? Then this just is 'The Place'If I lived anywhere close by - I'd prolly end my day with a visit to Milano.                                                            
-                                            Favourite one in entire Bangalore .. ideal way to finish a lazy weekend with their variety of amazing decadent ice creams .. wish they open more branches in Bangalore                                                             
-                                            Had been here this evening.. Nice ambience... Tried the banana split with 3 different scoops of fig and almond, pistachio, truffle... Was yummy...most amazing was the wild berries scoop!! If you are the berry type you must definitely taste it...every bite is so refreshing... Tried it with sweet crepe drizzled with Nutella... I think I should have tried honey drizzled crepe rather.. to go with the wild berries.. Besides they have a variety of flavours and seems like they keep experimenting different flavours everyday...Happy with the icecreams ‚ò∫                                                            
-                                            The best ice cream I have had in years.Was roaming through Indiranagar searching for the Pantaloon's showroom with friends. In between we understood that we lost our way..... and we stumbled up on this Milano outlet...I have been to the Kochi Milano and the taste of Ice Cream I had from there still lingers. So thought of taking friends to this branch in Indiranagar...Gosh... next 45 minutes... we just lost in the yummy ice creams.... different flavors... Ice cream is really creamy not the crystallized form that we get in other places..Guys never miss this place... One of the best places to have authentic ice cream at a very reasonable price !-                                            We r stayng very close to milano and use to b der once in a week.. so much awesomeness in everthing we find inside the shop, the cakes, the icecreams, the people..                                                             
-                                            My friend and I dropped by this place during the weekend. The ambience is good. They serve only 2 scoops or more starting at Rs 100. The quantity was good for the price.We had the wildberris which I felt was too sour. And a chocolate one which was good. Nothing extra ordinary!Tasted the Nutella gelato, but there was not a tiny bit of Nutella flavour in there!If you're around this area, give it a try!                                                            
-                                            This is located near CMH road in indiranagar opposite to costa coffee. It's a very small place. I wanted to try this ice cream for very long time. Milano had variety of ice creams. All the ice creams tasted real good. Finally decided to take sitapal and my friends chose wildberries, strawberry, Nutella, white chocolate and truffles. All the ice creams tasted very good. It's a must try !!!                                                            
-                                            A gelato parlour owned by a italian person, That gives this place a good amount of credidblity by itself.The Ice creams here are pretty good, and have some very unique flavors like Spriguli .The sundaes are really good too.The ice cream cakes gave me brain freeze üòÖüòÖ.and The menu is really really cheap, Especially compared to BR, iBaco,etc .                                                            
-                                            A very reasonably priced ice cream parlour with some amazing flavours. Loved their truffle, lemon and cheese cake flavours. The chocolate flavour was relatively less admirable.                                                             
-                                            Been here so many times. Their ice-cream cakes are amazing and reasonably priced. Ice-creams - 5/5 Staff (friendly) - 5/5 Price - 5/5Ambience - 5/5                                                            
-                                            Best gelato place in the history of Indiranagar. If it weren't so far off to where I live, I'd go here everyday! Some really interesting flavours. Wild berries is my favourite of all time though. Really great stuff.                                                             
-                                            I was introduced to this place by one of my friends few months ago. I am totally in love with the Gelatos here not only for the texture but also for different variety of flavors each time. They do not have a fixed menu and you are sure to see new flavors every day. I believe I have tried every single flavor and they are all truly amazing. They definitely live up to the name of Italian Gelato. One thing that makes me come back to this place again n again is the attitude of their staff - Nikhil, Shakti and one more guy(Don't know his name). We once reached the place around 1 am , they were obviously closed, however, they let us in thru the back door and we could enjoy our favorite ice creams. This place had never ever been disappointing and I would rate them 10 out of 5 if I could .. You guys rock!!!!                                                            
-                                            Loved the strawberry and creme brulee gelato! The strawberry gelato was sweet and tangy, with bits of the seed and fruit pulp hidden - which was a pleasant surprise with each spoonful. So much better than the usual essence-y ice creams that you get! The creme brulee gelato had lovely dark chocolate hints just shining through it. Wasn't that impressed by the Tiramisu though. The coffee flavor was too subtle. The vanilla gelato was also lovely, but I don't really like the flavor in general. This was, however, much nicer than the usual ice cream.Definitely going back to try their crepes, sundaes and ice cream cake!                                                            
-                                            Went to this place only after reading the zomato reviews...but did not find anything extra ordinary.  The wild berry flavour tasted like strawberry with ice. .dark chocolate and creme prule were good...pistachio not my flavour...not many variety..                                                            
-                                            Very happening ambience !! (Bright lights, hygienic, tables and chairs well placed, enough gang way, well mannered employees)The ice-creams are just mind blowing !!!Perfect place for a dessert !!Here for the first time and must say I am happy ! :)God luck team #milano üëèCheers ;)Sorry for that lame picture ! :P                                                            
-                    As a dessert nut with somewhat exacting standards, Milano more than satisfies my sweet tooth. I've tried several flavours over the course of several visits, and would recommend many of them quite highly.Quello, a mix of vanilla and caramel is among my firm favourites. Extra dark is spot on in terms of bitterness with just that hint of sweetness to balance things out. Wildberries is simply bursting with ''berriness'' and the unconventional pomegranate cheescake is definitely worth scooping up as well. Sadly, mango is out of season, and was yet another flavour that had me salivating.I tried mecrock - chocolate with crunchy bits and tiramisu. The latter is nice, but the lure of the flavours described earlier is far too strong. The mecrock is okay, perhaps too mild for my liking. Once again, I'd prefer the other, richer gelatos over this one.All in all, a superb dessert joint. The interiors are neat and well-lit, and the staff knows that they're serving up. But that matters little when the main thing - the gelato, is superb!

-                                            Have been to this place at 1030 and it was brimming with people. Its gelato has lower fat and is one of the guilt free ways to satisfy your sweet tooth. LOVED it's truffles and cheesecake scoops and I personally suggest you to try. If u are a dry fruit lover, almond tastes the best.                                                            
-                                            On a dessert crawl today - went to Milano after menchies.Loved the flavours ! I had the tiramisu and crime brulee - amazing! Kids tried hazelnut and dark chocolate ; and lemon and raspberry...And then I took away some pomegranate cheesecakeAll excellent! -                                            No words, Just AWESOME. Try everything here . Don't miss any scoop of ice cream. Hats off to the whole team for preparing this wonderful ice creams.                                                            
-                                            Where will you get an Avacado flavoured ice-cream? Yes, step in to Milano. I have been to this place specially to have Avacado ice cream. Up recently, hazelnut favour has also won my taste buds. I have also tried Mecrock and rafello favours and they are really good. Ice creams are mostly eggless. A must place to satisfy your ice cream cravings.                                                            
-                                            Gone to this place a couple of times and each time I see something new to have. They have a good range of gelato Flavors and some very nice desserts like icecream sandwich, truffle icecream and many more. The staff is very friendly and always have a smile on their face. I would recommend everyone to go there at least once. Because I know after that the only dessert place they will go is this one.                                                            
-                                            This place is located near CMH hospital, Indiranagar. You can park your vehicle outside the shop but they do not have any dedicated parking space.It's a well lit small place. There are about 6-7 tables with 4/2 chairs.I was standing infront of frosted glass doors and had to decide which ice-cream flavour to choose out of many.Two guys were serving the selected, mouth -watering ice-cream with smile.I tasted Mecrock (dark chocalate), Rafello, Avacado and Hazelnut. Hazelnut is my favourite and a must try.They serve cup with two flavours (100g) for Rs 100/- and cone for Rs 120/-.The feel of ice-cream is completely different from the conventional one.When it goes into your mouth it starts melt, melt ,melt... You can feel the uniformity ,softness and perfect sweetness.I bet if you are an ice-cream lover, you can't stop with one cup/cone for sure.-                                            We stumbled upon this place about a year ago and since then it has been our favourite and only ice cream joint in Bangalore. This place deserves nothing but 5 stars!                                                             
-                                            This was our first experience with Gelato and we loved it. I particularly liked the Sugar and Milk free Peach Sorbet and the Sugar free Chocolate. They also have a great range of frozen desserts which I should be trying soon.The place is clean, well lit and the staff is very well informed.
