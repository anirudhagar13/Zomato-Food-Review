-                                Typical south Indian food , with nice ambience and taste.  Price is decent as the capacity of food is more than expected.  It is run by Kerala cooperative society.  Had been to other outlets in Kerala.
-                The Indian Coffee House is a restaurant chain in India, run by a series of worker co-operative societies. It has strong presence across India with nearly 400 coffee houses, but has a clear Kerala connection.The India Coffee House chain was started by the Coffee Cess Committee in 1936, when the first outlet was opened in Bombay. In the course of the 1940s there were nearly 50 Coffee Houses all over British India. It was during the late 1890s that the idea was formed.Due to a change in the policy in the mid 1950s, the Board decided to close down the Coffee Houses. Encouraged by the communist leader A. K. Gopalan(AKG), the workers of the Coffee Board began a movement and compelled the Coffee Board to agree to handover the outlets to the workers who then formed Indian Coffee Workers' Co-operatives and renamed the network as Indian Coffee House. A co-operative began in Bangalore on 19 August 1957, and one was established in Delhi on 27 December 1957. Later Bellary and Madras (Chennai) Societies were separated from their mother societies.-                    The Indian Coffee House is a restaurant chain in India, run by a series of worker co-operative societies.

-                                Been going here for many years for my morning scrambled eggs. It's ditto every time. :-) I wonder how. But upkeep of the place is not good. Kitchen doesn't look very healthy either from inside. Time to repaint the place, boys. -                                After days of pining for this particular vintage establishment, happy to have finally set foot in it today. And the coffee didn't disappoint. Smelled like heaven, tasted like sunshine, and after-tasted like a good memory. Breakfast of scrambled eggs, omelette and masala dosa was on point. The prices low. The servers were all seniors, who served with s smile on their face. The food was on the table in 5 mins. What's not to love!
-                                The place doesn't seem the same anymore, though the ambience, furniture remains the same. The service was quick. The price is reasonable. However the taste has come down!
-                                This is the first time I visited this place after they shifted from MG Road. The place is a bit run down and they still have the same old furniture. It was empty and we had just coffee. The coffee was a tad sweet. I used to love their cutlets and omelettes.
-                                The location is perfect and its extremely pocket friendly.However, I did not like the coffee there, I prefer the lemon juice instead.The scrambled egg toast is really good, I like the omelet too.-                                The government set up is not government like in attitude.The white clothed waiters had been happy to serve and delighted us with their smile.filter coffee, veg cutlets and a nice omelette will keep you in high spirits.-                                            I was told this is a really old place. Looks so too, like the good old South Indian hotels. Authentic is the word! The place is really small and cozy with hustling old waiters dressed in white and red uniforms. One shouldn't look out for ambience. But, Great coffee, no doubt. I like the cutlets here. Good omelettes  too.
-                                            Indian coffee house is one of the legendary restaurants. The place has retained the old charm.We had masala dosa and a filter coffee. Masala dosa was loaded with butter and tasted average. Chutney and sambar was below average. Their popular Filter coffee was good.Staff are friendly and prices are moderate. Place is packed on weekends. So, you will have a wait for a while.-                                            After a long time of seeing this place on zomato and hearing a thing or 2 from others, we decided to visit this place on a Sunday morning. Went there a little late and were seated within 5 minutes. Ordered for a double egg omelette, upma, vada since Idly was over, cutlet, and bread toast. Must say that all was very very average and good quality and taste was found missing. Sambhar was like water and vada oily and cold. Upma was a savior though a little spicy. The cold coffee in the end was too good, very student type and was the best we had for the day's breakfast.
-                                            The first time I went to the Bangalore coffee house it was on MG Road at the best possible location. Now it's moved to church Street. These places are rich in history and the waiters don't care much about service. They are just fast and bad tempered.Try the scrambled egg and coffee if you are visiting.
-                                            Went to this place few weeks back when I was visiting bangalore.This place is very old school and takes you back to olden times. The bonus is, that it's very affordable to your pocket.Love the way the servers are dressed.-                                            This place needs no introduction to old Bangaloreans ..it's everything like old bengaluru ..laid back , easy going ,simple and quick service ...tomato and cucumber sandwich and poached eggs with toast are my fav ...yeps finish it off with steaming cup of coffee :) This place always brings a smile ...
-                                            Vintage Bengaluru, finally!  For the first time ever for me.. I know it's bad on me.. But better late than never huh... All nice nice from the time I stepped in... First deadly pointer : the time travelled servers and their mighty uniforms! They look Damn good and my server was polite too! -                                            It's your chai/kappi-thindi place. Simple cafe but has this old rustic charm to it. They have a one page menu and I had my usual favourite Cold Kappi and Eggs. This was a breakfast right after attending Sunday Church. Sometimes it's good to come to places like this, it reminds you to appreciate the simple things in life.
-                                            Another place in Bangalore where you shouldn't go purely for the food. Go there to experience the Bangalore of yore.We normally have their omelettes, toasts, mutton cutlets, and coffee.-                                            Waiters with a colonial clothing and old school ambiance , a combination of these two adds up to Indian Coffee House. The patrons of this restaurant are are often old Bangaloreans who come by to get a feel of good old times. The food was average. The waiters, most of whom should have retired a decade ago are often forgetful and lack etiquette. The place is very warm and i'm sure it would get uncomfortable if its summer. Its a dying restaurant which needs resurrection. Worth trying if you are around MG Road. After all restaurants like these may not be for long. Must try : Mutton Cutlet ,Sandwiches and Coffeee!!!Value For Money : 3/5, Ambiance: 2.5/5, Service: 2.5/5, Taste 3/5.
-                                            But for the feeling of sitting in a restaurant which has been running for decades there isn't much to the place. Food doesn't taste great. Service is quick but untidy. There are elements of once present but now lost sophistication. Don't try the sandwiches. Cutlet n dosas tasted fine. Do have the coffee here.
-                                            We decided to visit this place for lunch and we regret our decision. The ambiance was bad and their menu was limited. We ordered Masala Dosa and Meal. The dosa filling was cold and tasteless. The meal was cold and Sambhar/Rasam was plain, no taste at all. Finally we ordered coffee and found it was not worth the price. The hand wash area was dirty. This place spoilt our mood and hence have decided never to visit this place again. Avoid at all cost.
-                                            The place needs no introduction. It's a different experience all together. We tried most of the items. Mutton cutlet is must have. Coffee is good. Eggs items are good with scrambled eggs and fried eggs being the best. Don't forget to tip the waiter, you will genuinely feel happy.
-                                            If you want to travel back to 80's, this should be on your list.Except their location, nothing has changed here (neither furniture not the waiters :-) )-                                            Whoa, nothing beats this place. Ordered a masala dosa, an omelette of two eggs and a cold coffee. Served in a jiffy, and finished in no time! If you're in the area, definitely pay a visit at this wonderful place.
