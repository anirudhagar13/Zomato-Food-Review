Ok..went to Bangalore, didn't go here? Waste actually! It represents Karnataka food in the best possible manner! You will be amazed to see the crowd outside even on a weekday. There was a big queue in which we had to stand but yes very systematic extremely hygienic and ofcourse delicious dosa, idli, vada at a very cheap rate. I started with coffee and ended with kesari bhat. Great experience. P.S. Order 2 dosas at once to avoid queue again because no one can have just one :)

After watching a movie we were very hungry and didn't have a lot of money to have lunch in an expensive restaurant. So we decided to eat over here. We had masala dosa, mosambi juice, lassi and watermelon juice. The price is affordable and the food quality is great. It's a perfect place to have cheap yet delicious lunch.

Visited this place on my second day in Bangalore and I was left speechless. The place is very small and jam packed with people but the maintenance of hygience and processes is simply amazing. We took most of the options in their menu including masala dosa, vada, idli, chowchow bath. I have never had idli that just melts in your mouth. The masala dosa was loaded with ghee but I didn't mind it as it was very yummy. Kesari bath was something that I have never tried before and I found it pretty good .Definitely going to this place again. Hopefully soon.

Finally visited the highest rated place in Bangalore, and it was a great experience !USP: The level of hygiene maintained and the cheap prices !What I liked: The food was delicious , the prices very extremely cheap ( 20 rs for masala dosa ! ) and the level of hygiene maintained was extra ordinary ! They had invested a lot on expensive machines such as dishwashers and all the staff had appropriate kitchen clothing. Really impressive.What I didn't like: There is always a huge crowd, and they don't serve sambhar with any of the dishes.Food:a) Masala Dosa: Ample quantities of ghee makes it so delicious !b) Vada: Crunchy to perfection and soft on the inside !c) Filter Coffee: Definitely one of the best in bangalore ! &-
This place has outstanding service as there were separate counters for dosa and other food items.It is clean and serves great dosa. However, it only serves the green chutney and not the sambar with dosa/idli. Overall, I liked the experience here.

A very close place to where I stay, for a quick south Indian yummy breakfast... my most frequently visited place... all the dishes on the menu tastes really good...

Bangalore has so many legendary food places and mark this into one of them. Ghee dipped Masala dosa with mouthwatering coconut chutney. Fluffy idli and crispy vadas .. they just get disappears in your mouth when you eat them...You have to eat more and more here.. No one can eat just one...It's very much affordable. 20 rs Masala 10 rs idli 10 rs vada.  Too much crowd... But the place is enough to accommodate all.. Parking is easily available...How can I miss a cup of coffee... It's Divine. -    Every time when I go to Jayanagar,  I make up my mind to go here but looking at the crowd I always return.So this time we went around evening before they opened,  thinking we  will be the only jobless people,  well well apparently all people came thinking the same :P      I expected people to lose patience and fight with each other looking at the crowd (that's how we roll :P) but they are quite disciplined and makes the whole process  hassle free, the queue for dosa does require some level of patience.       Coming to food,  I love the chutney and the lemony flavour to it, idlis I have eaten better ones in veena stores!!  And dose was with with utmost perfection( your patience pays off)  and the amount of tuppa you certainly wouldn't mind dying out of cholesterol :P,  coffee the best after MTR (brownie points for the cups), kept the star dish for the end Kesari bath FTW!!  I loved the veena stores one,  but this was way better and they even Add pineapple to it which makes it even more amazing. The most amazing part more than Kesari bath was I just paid 75 bucks for all of it (you Ll medium fries in that cash) you can always get clean,  hygienic tasty food for less rate :P

Very nice place and always crowded in the morning time .... All items are very less price..U eat and fill tummy as much u can...only thing u have to wait in queue to get items...Taaza thindi is awesome place in Bangalore to have breakfast
-
I would definitely give them 5 on 5 because they are by far the best breakfast hub when it comes to South Indian food. All the time full crowded yet getting your food won't take much time, however, dosa counters do need some level of patience. We do regularly visit the Jayanagar outlet and ordering chow chow bath, idly vada and tea/bournvita is a must. Fluffy and soft idlis along with my personal favorite tangy lemony chutney - something to definitely die for. Dosas are a bit oily though but simply love the taste and flavor.Neat and clean ambiance, hygienic food and above all, super pocket friendly. What more do you need for a great sumptuous breakfast? Highly recommended.
-Pocketfriendly and very tasty and the price of 1990 u get all the dishes of menu below 25rs, has an award for most hygienic restaurant in Bangalore
-        Been wanting to eat here for so long, finally made up my mind, packed my cycle and went. Wow, what an experience. Thought I'll catch them early and be the only one when they open, reached by 7.15 am, and there is a queue already!! Thought I'll have to fight it out to get my food, but no. Suddenly I see people behaving and standing in line patiently. There is a queue for everything, hence you get your food quicker than most darahinis even if it's super crowded. Once you pick up your food, want chutney, there is a separate counter. You love the vada and want one more, but see the queue for coupon and want to leave it... well there is a guy who is floating around and you can top up there. Different counters and queues for idli, dosa, coffee make it very organised. And clean. Very clean. Food wise, I like the chutney in Veena stores better, but loved the idli and vada. Just too good. But the best part, what TT is proving to us, is good, clean food doesn't need to be expensive. 1 plate idli vada and 1 coffee cost me 40 rupees. In this day and age, anywhere else it's not possible. Overall, big respect for Taaza Thindi. They deserve the 4.9 rating on Zomato completely.

But the best part, what TT is proving to us, is good, clean food doesn't need to...-No need to use ur grey cells of brain to figure out why dis place is jam packed... It was my first time over here the first thing that stoods out is the crowd and probably one myt thing it will take a long time to get the food.... But it is so damn good organized the entire process its just mind blowing it just took me 2mins to get the food.... Also u can see the process how they are making the food and the cleaning as well in a proper sterilizer that u myt wonder dat are u in a 3 star restaurant..... Oh did I forget to tell the pricing just 20 for dosa and 10 for an idli.... Also luckily I got a coupon 4 a free coffee as well... Tastewise I wud say its the second best dosa I have had in bangalore..... Also the idli were damn soft and fluffy.... Go dere to believe it guys
-I guess the best place to find yourself the meal. Its cheap and too tasty. How would you react when you get a masala dosa just for rs 20 and its finger licking good. The quality served is too good. Loved the place in whole!!
-On a Monday morning around 8:30AM , this place was slightly crowded where they had queue system for both placing order and collecting food. Tried their Masala Dosa for 20 bucks and it was decent.One of those rest. where you can't really complain much because they ain't charging you a lot and entire menu of rest. is within 150 bucks .Food - 3.5/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 4/5Value for Money - 5/5
-Very good place for some quick ,south indian delicacy like Kharabath( upgraded upma) chow chow bath ( duo ,kesari bath and kharabath duet) and Masala dosa yumm.... and u will get some nice hot filter coffee and tea...only these things  available over there with reasonable price and quick supply of them.It will be open from 9 to 12 pm and from 4 to 8 pm .Its located next to cake wala ,ssmrv college.Must visit once;)
-The food is not bad. The food is no great shakes. Yes, the masala Dosa is good. But, it is not as delicious as the reviews make it out to be. The coffee is good.The crowd here after 7.15-7.30 is horrendous! A minimum waiting time for 20minutes in queue for food! So, yes, do try this place out to know what the hype is all about and move on in life. Be sure to get here by 7!
-I had heard a lot about this place and the ratings, well, 4.9/5 on Zomato. It ought to be extra-ordinary. I thought the place was nice and they serve really good Dosas, Idlis and Vadas. Even though there is a queue here, you'd get your order pretty much quickly. The prices are so less that with 100 bucks, you'd be able to fill your stomach quite easily. The chutney was amazing, I mean, it was one of the bests I have ever had. This place doesn't have extra ordinary food, but the prices and its simple yet effective food, makes it a must visit place in Bangalore.
-I could identify this place by the huge crowd waiting in line for food. The menu is very limited. The quantity of food is much lesser than what you would expect... But it is priced accordingly. The masala dosa is too good and a must try. The vada was pretty average. Service was extremely fast. Staff was courteous.Tip: If you want to skip the crowded payment counter, there is a guy inside the restaurant who can give you coupons.
-A very good place to have regular south Indian delicacy like idli, vada, filter coffee.Tried idli vada, kharabhat, kesarbhat and filter coffee. Ambiance: Very crowded place you need to stand in queue for your order.Taste: Very good taste and very simple in flavours.Service: Very quick for idli and vada but for dosa you need to wait for at least 20 mins.Value for money: 9/10.-Great place for tasty breakfast. Very very very reasonable price for food not sure how they make money at this pricing but masala dosa for 20 seriously !!.. and food is really very tasty. In weekend queue is big Sonu might have to wait for 10 min approx but it's worthy ...
-Everything is well prepared and of remarkable tasty. They are popular for south Indian breakfast food. They have a very limited menu but all are deliciously made. I liked the idly, its so soft like it will melt on your moth no need to chew. And the best part is they have unbeatable price rate.Recommended to all my friends coz once I tried the food there and now I have become a fan of this place.
-        Visited this place after looking at its rating on Zomato. The place was thronged by hundreds of people when we reached there. They define the actually fast food, I've never seen service so fast in my life. Yes and their main advantage the cost of the food, but i wasn't impressed as it was a business strategy( 5/5 for the business strategy though). The quantity was half compared to other food joints hence the price cut as well which people fail to see. Their Masala Dosa (4.5/5) was very crispy and yeah it was small making peopleopt for one more. The chutney blends well. & Coming to Idli Vada (4/5). they were tiny as i described earlier but yeah felt it was worth it. Khara bath(4/5) Liked it but quantity was very very less and Kesari Bath(4/5) I felt it was yum but my friend who accompanied hated it for some reason. The joint is kept very clean and tidy and sevice is & excellent as is said. Seating for & a few is available but people prefer standing.Overall a nice experience and yeah would love to visit again.Ambiance: 3/5Food: 4.5/5Staff: 5/5Value for money: 4/5

Visit it once and you will know why? Small place with no seating area. Just meant for a quick breakfast or evening snacks. The place gets very crowded unless you are early. You would either have to eat standing or find a make-do seating outside the restaurant. We had both Masala Dosa and Idly-Wada here. Cost the three of us under 200 bucks. When it comes to the food, you will have no reasons to complain. These are among the best that you would find in Bangalore. Go for Masala Dosa if you want a preferred choice. They give a great deal of importance to Hygiene. So, please don't worry about the quality. Recommend it always.
-Nothing to beat the taste, cleanliness, and value of this place. I love the idlis, vadas and the chutney here. The coffee is pretty good too, most of the times, manage to drink 2 - 3 of them. Anyone in Bangalore must make it a point to visit this place at least one time!
-Living in Malleshwaram, my expectation from South Indian food is higher solely because of the high standards set by the likes of veena stores, CTR, Hotel Janta and Raghavendra Stores. However the food at taaza thindi does indeed give good competition to these old establishments. The idlis are super soft and the masala dosa is super yummy. The Khara bath is quite different but super tasty and the coffee is great. Definitely a must visit for everyone. The super low prices and hygienic ambience is a plus over the delicious food.
-I always wanted to eat here n today was that day ,the weather was perfect to have a plate of hot vada n to sip on a piping hot cup of coffee ,this place lives up to its reputation the food is amazing although they have a very limited menu ,what they have to offer is by far the best Indian breakfast that I have had ,the place is super clean ,management is amazing , only thing they could improve on is to go easy on the oil on the dosa but apart from that the food was amazing
-Wat can u say abt this place... Just one word "awesome"They have raised the bar in hotel industry, hats off to their cleanliness and customer service. And the price ,    my god such a less price and the quality they give us amazing... Good work frm u guys keep going ... Wanna see more branches of urs in other areas ...
-A Saturday morning stroll on this road after logging out of office introduced Me to this staple place.I came across a horde at 7am. Intrigued by this, I checked what was the deal about and I found a place serving piping hot South Indian staples.Eager to try the food here, I called a few friends and in a few mins We were all there gorging on delicious food.Their menu is limited, but all the items are yummy and worth a try.Hygiene, Taste, Quality &amp; Price... which We all look forward in an eatery are all taken care of an that seems to be their USP.This place is never to be missed. Strikes a chord with people of all age groups.The staff are friendly.Hygiene is a major draw for Me at this place.-Rated 4.9 on zomato, I was super keen on trying this place and I am glad I did. Nothing like the places I usually visit, this place is a LITTLE more than a street side idli-dosa stall- one of many you find in Bangalore. What sets this place apart is the level of cleanliness and hygiene, which is totally praise-worthy. The place has a very limited menu- plain and masala dosa, idle, vada, filter coffee is what I tried. I was immensely impressed by the dosa. It was fresh, filling and quite tasty. A point to note for all North Indians like me- Food is not served with SAMBHAR, only coconut chutney. I was honestly quite surprised by the price of each item- INR 20 for a Masala Dosa, that's very cheap for the quality they ensure. Finally, if you visit this place, be ready to stand in a queue and to eat standing up.
-Very Good place for Breakfast or evening snacks.Not too many choices. The food is very decent with reasonable price. The Masala Dosa was the tastiest.
-This place is like the role model for industrial revolution of restaurants... Everything is process driven to achieve perfection.. The prices are really pocket friendly and they have a limited menu... Was here for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 8 45 and this place was already crowded with a line for taking tokens... &Tried the idly and vada .. very well prepared and perfect on how it suppose to taste...Next was the chow chow bath, The holy combination of kesari bath and khara bath, tasted great as well.. As an icing on the cake you get half coffee free for khara bath and this costs you just 25 bucks.Last was the masala dosa, at 20 bucks you get hygienically well prepared  &dosa which tastes great...Wish I stayed this side of town to come here often :)
-Finally made it to this popular no-frills joint! Only idlis and vadas were available (since we were there at 11:45) and both were excellent. Both came dunked in yummy homestyle chutney 😋 Great coffee too. Super clean place and we got space to sit on the benches and enjoy our meal.
-Visited this place on Thursday, at 9.00am with a friend who has visited this place before. I guess i was 15th person in the queue and my friend told " oh ! Its less crowded today !".This should give you an idea about the waiting.Hats off to the people who has patience to take pictures of their food and upload here.I just stuffed it as soon as i got it!Here menu is limited and price is less when you consider the tasty food. Commensurately the quantity is less.I ate 3 idli, 2 vada, 1 masala dosa and had 1 Tea!Dosa was oily but tasty.Idli and Vada were great.Even I tasted Karabhat it was good and different.If you are not staying nearby then both traffic and crowd in the hotel will test your patience. Better visit once and decide.
-        Been here a few times for breakfast to satisfy my dosa cravings. This joint runs purely on the basis of the quality of food served. Every inch of the space available is occupied due to the inevitable rush throughout the week. You need to wait in long queues to get your order but the service is efficient. Have tried their idly, vada and dosas (plain/masala). The clear favourite among 90% of the mass is definitely the masala dosa. Being aware of that, they have it ready in bulk for fast service (freshly prepared). The dosas are quite oily due to the excess ghee but I assure you it's a healthy choice if consumed early in the day. 😉 The other items on the menu are quite decent as well. They serve limited chutney on the plate but the customers can return for an additional serving from their chutney counter. The point being, they don't encourage wasting food. Almost forgot to mention the steaming hot coffee which ensures a great start to the day. Pricing is super reasonable ranging from 10-20 bucks per item. Also, they don't have a delivery or takeaway option. So if you want to avoid the large crowd and enjoy eating at home, you need to carry your own receptacles to parcel the food! I am assuming they don't support the use of plastic bags as well 😬 Overall, a must visit! 🙂

It is a very neat and clean restaurant with only few items in their menu. They have kept it less but did no compromise with the quality. A huge crowd turns up there every morning, still they manage the consistency in taste and quality. I decided to go there after seeing their rating on Zomato; it's the highest rated restaurant.The ambience is not something you need to worry about here. It's a small place but you will surely get place to sit after some wait probably.The food is quite amazing. We ordered Idli Vada and their famous cuisine Masala dosa. Masala dosa was the best, crisp and tasty. Idli was also very soft. However, they don't serve Sambhar but only Chutni.Service is the best thing there. They are real quick and in minutes you will get your food. They have separate counters for Dosa, Idli-Vada and Coffee/Tea which makes it easier for the crowd to receive their order, quicker also at the same time.Lastly and most importantly, it's very cheap. Even in 50 bucks, you can eat stomach full.This one is definitely challenging the Classic South-indian breakfast places of Bengaluru. However, I feel it's time for them to add new items to their menu now.-Great value for less money. An amazing breakfast place hidden in the streets of Jayanagar.

-When you head to this restaurant on a weekend morning, be prepared to be greeted by long queues and no seating. This is yet another QSR with minimalist ambience and cheap yet hygienic South Indian breakfast. For the locals who're used to Veena stores and CTR in Malleshwaram, this restaurant wouldn't be any different but for a non local who discovered this place solely through zomato's high rating - it would be a bit of a shocker. If big crowds and standing road side in a cramped space to eat isn't your thing; please ignore this restaurant.The menu is simple and the prices do tend to shock you. No dish is priced more than 20 bucks. Must try: Masala Dosa. Let me fore warn you, no sambar is served here :) Also do try the Coffee.Meal for two: Maximum 100 bucks Note: There's no car parking anywhere close to the restaurant and you'd have to spend at least 15 minutes going around the neighborhood hunting for a free spot, on weekends. Don't think weekdays would be any different.
-Amazing, amazing and just amazing. What a price, quality,  quantity they are giving. No one can beat their taste and maintenance. Must visit. Limited menu with unlimited taste.
-I had come here once. I don't get the hype. Yes, food is good but it's not excellent and the fact that I have to wait 20 mins for my food and eat it standing at the roadside doesn't make sense. It's very inexpensive but then again it doesn't matter. You need to have at least two of the following.1. Great food2. Long Waiting 3. Place to sit
-One more place off my wish list. However I am sure I want to keep it in my list to visit here again and again.Service was pretty fast, and plates as well as spoons were properly cleaned.Heavy crowd says it all. The attendants are really efficient and polite.Now, coming to food, there idly was really fluffy and melts right in mouth. Vada was very tasty, without too much oil. Masala dose were really crisp as well as thick, eating those with their chutney were soo good that we packed some for later.Just removed 0.5 points for much oil in Masala dose.It would never stop us from going here again and again.
-Taaza as the name says it's always fresh and pure. One of the best place for South Indian food. The dosa rate has never hiked since it has been opened. Who gives a dosa for 20 bucks!?  These people here do and it is one of the finest cooked with the high end material. Idli for one will cost u 10 bucks. Coffee or tea is 10 again.. Coffee is just the perfect filter coffee and they don't compromise on the quanity though they giving it for 10.Kersaaaaari bath on of  the finest I have ever had. One thing I love about this place is the hygiene and the team work.. They never compromise on anything.. Just a perfect place.. I will be going again and aging and again till I die.
-Holy Grail.When it comes to value-for-money breakfast experience, there is no beating this place. Its mesmerizing. It is a traditional Bangalore breakfast place with a modern twist. Their processes are very well organized to manage the crowd of such scale. They@ have exactly 13 items on the menu including extra butter and extra palya. There is no table chair seating, they have verandas and stand-n-eat platforms. Having been to CTR and other breakfast places, I can vouch for their service It is unlike what you ewould expect. The food is good. Masala Dosa is their highest selling item and rightly so. The dosa at Sri Guru Kotteshwara Benne Dosa is definitely better, but that place doesn't match the experience that this place provides. Tried the masala dosa, vada and badam milk at a total expense of Rs.50. Value for money at its best.Overall, its a  must visit, a temple for food lovers.Ambience: 5/5Service &amp; Staff: 5/5Food: 5/5Value for Money: 5/5-        Well, doing great dishes out of innovation is one thing, although making simple things in a great way is no less.One of the best places for masala dosa and idly in town.Been here at least ten times, and I'd strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone!Must try : Masala dosa (adding butter is optional)IdlyVadaHave tried kesaribath, it's good too, the only thing which was not up to the mark was kharabath.-Well, doing great dishes out of innovation is one thing, although making simple things in a great way is no less.One of the best places for masala dosa and idly in town.Been here at least ten times, and I'd strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone!Must try : Masala dosa (adding butter is optional)IdlyVadaHave tried kesaribath, it's good too, the only thing which was not up to the mark was kharabath.-5 isnt enough for this place, just not. I went there on a saturday morning and was disappointed first looking at the crowd. But exactly after 2 minutes I was out of the long queue with my idli, kharabath and also dosa. They have this amazing speed and order all in perfect place. The chutney here is too good, that no sambhar here is not even a bother. Their hygiene is also undoubted and perfect. The costs are very very minimal, all around 20 rs. I just loved this place!!
-Don't call yourself a foodie if you haven't been here! The best masala dosa the best idlis and vadas. Mouth watering! And everything at the cheapest rate you cannot even think of :) Their cleanliness and maintenance is just next level. The importance they give to hygiene is much appreciated. As I write the review, the first thing m gonna do tomo morning is have idli vada here :p
-This place is good for a quick breakfast and a good one too and if you got a limited budget no problem.  Eat tasty masala dosa and coffee and rush to work or better you can parcel it too.
-Have just 20 bucks in your wallet? You think you can't go to a decent hotel? That's enough to visit this place. The quality of food is nothing less than any darshini in Bangalore. The masala dosa is coated with a spoon of ghee and chutney. The idli-vada combo is too good and the chow-chow bath also tastes really good. I love the fact that you can buy extra butter to eat with your dosa and this makes your experience so much more better. All the items on the menu costs 10 or 20 rupees and they haven't hiked the price since it's inception. I also love the fact that no matter what happens, the customers form a queue to collect their order. The hotel serves only chutney and no sambar. The place is a mad house on weekends and on holidays. But the quality of food is worth the wait. Must go.
-        Delicious and hygienic place for a south Indian meal ! They invested in these 2 (ignoring other aspects) and folks come here expecting a super experience on these two only. We tried Plain Dose, Masala Dose, Idli and Vada. Vada was hot and crisp - find this a rarity in most places. Idli melted easily in mouth. Dose seemed to have a special batter. They are thicker and crispier. Served with chutney only, sambhar lovers would be disappointed a bit. But then we didn't go there expecting sambhar - we wanted to experience what this place is known for.Couldn't help trying other delicacies (they have a small menu and they do full justice to each item) - chow-chow bath, kharabath and coffee. All were yummy.Special mention on hygiene - they use organic dish washing liquid and international dish washing equipment (can be seen by any visitor) and infra red equipment for disinfection of spoons.The place has limited seating and standing space. Designed deliberately I think so that people feel the high demand (most people will have to stand and eat). They manage the crowd well through the queue system and the staff was found to be friendly in spite of so much crowd to be managed.Finally, the prices are so reasonable that one wonders if they make a loss on per unit! Good for us and for them as they make money on volumes.

-To have the best masala dosa in town you better visit this place. The food here is mouth watering, especially the dosa. The dosa, idli- vada and everything else is very consistent in taste. Everything is made to perfection in this amazing place. The food is also super cheap considering the Hygiene and quality they follow. The only drawback, its overcrowded all the time.
-One of the best south indian eatouts in Jayanagar. Known for their cleanliness and quality of food.It is not a fine-dine place where you can eat aaram se. But the quality of food is worth it. There is a lot of family crowd here. This is a really good place for parcel food.
