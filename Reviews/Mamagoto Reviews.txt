-                                            Always had a great experience here. The starters are really good. The main course disappointed us this time but I'd love to believe it was an exception. The staff here is extremely well trained and a good benchmark for other players.                                                             
-                    We decided to pay this outlet a visit on a Sunday afternoon after having heard about its fame in Delhi NCR. This place serves South East Asian food, which is one of my personal favorites. We ordered Crispy batter fried Calamari in starters. In main course we ordered Osaka Tube Station Chicken Bowl- it's wholesome and can be easily shared by 2 people. Very flavorful broth.We also ordered Laksa Prawn soup which was one of my favorites. The body of the soup was coconut milk, lemongrass and ginger. This dish can also be easily shared by 2 people. The portion size is very good and certainly worth the money.We ended our meal with delectable handmade coconut and palm sugar icecream. It was out of the world and left us craving for more. The fact that it was hand made was clearly evident from its rich texture and choice of high quality ingredients.My final ratings would be:Ambience: 4/5Menu selection: 4/5Food quality and taste: 4/5Service was efficient and hence rated 4/5.-                        We decided to pay this outlet a visit on a Sunday afternoon after having heard about its fame in Delhi NCR.

I simply love their Pan Fried Noodles. Its amazing. The interior is good and the location is quite happening surrounded by couple of other eateries. A must visit                                                            
-                                            Food and liquor options are excellent...So are the staff and the ambience too.. fabulous..Very prompt and helpful service..Only drawback i felt is the quantity per price...can do better!                                                            
-                                            The food was good, but I think the place could be a little more lively. Music wasn't great either, the servers could be more welcoming in my opinion.                                                             
-                                            Highly recommended.This place has never let me down when it comes to their variety of soups. Have been there twice and plan to go there again some day soon.Trust me for this place you can chose anything blindly or maybe ask the waiter and let mamagoto play its magic.                                                            
-                                            Overall good experience. The ambiance isn't that great. The interior is attractive but the sitting arrangements is not up to the mark. Coming to the food, we ordered hakka noodles which was good. Chicken dumplings were nice. The coconut and palm sugar ice cream is far better than other ice creams. First time, I ate this item. Courteous staff.  I recommend this place to everyone.                                                            
-                                            Hustling with patrons and activity always this is a good place to head for... Head out when you have a agenda with your friends. Pre booking a table is not always a possibility since the place is always overflowing.Good food! Great service                                                            
-                                            One of my favorite places in Indiranagar. Although this is slightly on the higher side, I feel the quality of the food never lets me down. It is quite authentic and considering that it's a chain of restaurants now they have managed to maintain the quality really well. Ambience is top class. I give it a 4 and not a 5 because, sometimes I feel the menu gets a bit repetitive. All in all a nice place to go out with friends and family.                                                             
-                                            Best asian restaurant till date..i was very lucky to have made reservation and there was like quite occupied place and long que.Food i could rate it 4.5/5Ambience:4.5/5Service too is 4.5/5                                                            
-                                            This review is for only food as we ordered food from here for dinner through Zomato while celebrating an achievement in one of my friends house. I have heard about it from so many friends and they didn't let me down.This is most definitely among the top Oriental food destination in Bangalore. For delivery, the packaging of food was really peppy and attractive, makes you feel good about eating.Food is great, we ordered crispy lamb and Prawn dumplings as starters, all of them delicious. The pork belly dish and noodles were also lip smacking. The quality of fish was really good(as a Bengali I'm certifying ðŸ˜‚).The price is a little higher but it's worth every penny you pay. Overall I loved the experience.                                                            
-                    Perfect place for asian and oriental cuisine. I just loved this place. I was here with my friend for dinner when i entered this place it looked like some warehouse with some Chinese posters pasted on wall which gives you the feel that you having food on asian streets. Here you can taste the actual asian food. Its not everyone's cup of tea but if you admire the asian cuisine taste this is the place you need to try. Its little costly than you usual places but what the heck it can be ignored for yummy food.We orderedStarters : Veg Spring roles , Honey chicken , Cheese and truffle oil dumplings and Crystal dumplingsMain courses : Veg pan fried noodlesDeserts : Caramel Toffee cake with venila ice cream (must try)The food was amazing. Honey chicken was yumm.. the chicken was very tender. The honey and soya sauce was well made, I was able to taste sweety and spiciness together. Perfect blend i must say.Must try crystal dumplings. Even though we didnt order it, the waiter severed it to us by mistake and later they didnt even bill it.-                        Perfect place for asian and oriental cuisine. I just loved this place.

The staff were very amicable and efficient but the food didn't pack the said flavour bomb it claims to have. Everything seemed quite ordinary.Pros : 1. The ramen bowls and rice bowls are worth the money you pay. Good hearty portions. Serves 2 people comfortably2. Good ambience and musicCons:1. Expensive considering some items are very small in portion2. Lacks the expected flavor bomb-                                            I stepped in to Mamagoto for a casual lunch. I had not planned it and just came out of office and while searching for a place to have lunch, I walked in to this place. The place has a strange decor and it looks like a warehouse. The place was empty when I stepped in and the waiters greeted us warmly.The food was great and some of the best oriental I have had. I used to go to Mainland china often but this may be my new choice. The prices are on the higher side but more or less comparable to mainland china.I will visit this place once more to try out some more stuff and update this review.                                                            
-                                            Situated in the heart of Indiranagar, this place isn't so difficult to spot. It's absolutely Asian and the food tastes lovely. The presentation, ambience and service all score a 4.5. For the price it could be rated low as its on the expensive side. Really, the competition is so high that one would lookout for a place where there would be value for their money and there are plenty at the moment that offers you that. However, overall, if it's the food that really matters, this place should be on your top choice list.                                                            
-                                            One of the best Asian food places we have visited in recent times. Flavors are different than usual Chinese or Thai place. Crispy Lotus Stem is must have and also their rice bowls.                                                             
-                                            This place never disappoints me. Its one of the few places that rate high in my list of places that I can always fall back on of I want to ensure I experiement a new dish and not be disappointed at the same time. Recommend their Thai food... Yummmmy! And the funky ambience adds to the experience!                                                            
-                                            Ordered Corn pepper salt when i was sitting idle nd nothing to do at my hotel room.. And their corns were so tasty although I couldnt what was spinach for with that much quantity (though I mixed it with the corns).                                                             
-                                            We tried Prawns Crackers, Chicken Satay and Chicken basil cups for starters.And Spicy chicken Ramen Bowl for mains. Starters were good but Ramen Bowl was lip smacking.Overall a Good start to the weekend.                                                            
-                                            Awesome food guys. Haven't eaten such good food in a long time! Definitely visiting this place again! Loved the drinks and Main course. :) #mustgo                                                            
-                                            Out of the many places that serve or claim to serve Thai food in the city, Mamagoto is definitely my go to place. I find that their flavours are closer to being authentic than any other place. The soggy basil fried rice is delicious. So is the fiery shrimp friedrice. The Thai fried egg that comes with adds to the authenticity. The curries are great too! Their home delivery is also prompt and packed really well. The only reason I do not give it a 5 is because I like my Thai food to be really hot and their fried rice didn't quite get to that level, but that's a small matter. Definitely try the place!                                                             
-                                            Decent food with interesting ambience. Located in buzzing Indiranagar this place offers great variety of Chinese food. Service is really good.                                                            
-                                            My favorite place!! My cousin introduced me to this place and ever since I have fallen in love with it!Recommended : Prawn Crackers Usually I have their Apple Cinnamon Sangria. Which is just so yummm with their Pan Asian Food. Alongside you can go for their Prawn Crackers , Pad Thai and a Shrimp dish that I'm unable to recollect the name. If you are a dim sum fan, you should go for that too! They have a variety of it! It is a dim lit place with amazing interiors and very sweet people to greet you. Great service and great food!

-                                            While the decor of the place is unique and has an Asian street-food venue like touch with paintings on asbestos sheets for walls-- do not be fooled for this place as authentic Asian. I have travelled Asia widely from Taipei to Indonesia, Bangkok and Malaysia to Hongkong and Singapore, and I can tell you that the overload of spice in this place, and some weird cross-mix recipes of their dishes are plainly inspired by Indian street food carts that make 'Chinese fried rice'. I have been here twice, and both times was utterly disappointed. Also ends up leaving a big fat hole in your pocket without the satisfaction. (Also please note how all reviews below give a low rating under the 'Value for Money' category too. )

-                                            Visited this place today afternoon. This review is basically for the friendliest staff I've seen and a typical oriental ambiance. The staff were awesome, the food was served fast. The prices are on the higher end but yeah you feel its worth it. Coming to food,Starters: Thai Crispy Vegetable(One of the best Oriental dishes Ive tasted, it was very well made and went well with sauce they gave), Street Style Spicy Dumplings( Below average, for some reason didnt find it spicy and worth the money for the quantity provided. I've had better dumplings in related oriental restaurants. Would have rated it 5 if this had gone well)Main course: Bali Barnie Noodles(Excellent and very well made, perfect spiciness and the 'Hakka' style)Really liked the containers they served their variety sauce and ketchup. Overall a wonderful experienceAmbiance: 4.5/5Food: 4.5/5Staff: 4.5/5Value for money: 3.5/5                                                            
-                    Was planning Mamagoto for a long time. Thinking of the traffic would end up ordering freshmenu.com. This Sunday, thought of being a bit Oriental and wifey was also feeling like having Thai. So started the search for an "Asian" dining place for lunch. Having read good reviews of Mamagoto, thought would try. Opened up the menu option of Zomato (really like this feature of the Zomato product) and it read Thai all over. Decision was made. We have no qualms of trying any restaurant which serves some level of Thai food. Called them up and they said that they are sold out. We just wanted a tablet for two, so we decided to just try they walkin tables, even though on phone they said it's not available. It would be becoz of our lack of punctuality. To get our table we are in the habit of saying 5 minutes without turning up well past 20 min in reality. We were there in 15 min and got a seat. Food was excellent. -                        Was planning Mamagoto for a long time. Thinking of the traffic would end up ordering freshmenu.com.

The starters we tried were great- the veg basil cups, watercress spring roll and the spicy dumplings. All our mains were great but the clear standout was the thai red curry. Cant wait to go back!                                                            
-                                            Being an ardent chinese cuisine lover, I definitely feel this is one of the best place to appease your taste buds. The food is flavoury and piquant. I have visited this place twice and everytime I crave to visit again. I went with my family and after a long queue we finally bagged our chance to get our table. The bacon wrapped prawn and the honey chicken was awesome. Valet parking is available and the place has a great layout and decor. The mojitos were perfect too. Will definitely be back!                                                            
-                                            The first thing that really caught my eyes was the burst of colors and the caption "anything that swims, crawls, walks and flies with its back to the heaven is edible". Perfect place for a foodie. Loved the ambience and the comfort seating. Had prawns wrapped in bacon... it was ok. Not that great as expected but the chicken skewers were juicy and compensated for the prawns. Main course spicy ramen with buttered corn and spinach. My perfect comfort food. The broth was right amount of spice and so light and bursting with flavours. Loved it. What best way to end the meal- toffee caramel sponge cake with icecream. Don't get fooled by this simple combination- this one tops the meal. Perfect dessert. Overall loved the dining experience.                                                            
-                                            One restaurant I would always love to come back. Be it the food, ambience or the reception; everything was top class. Traditional Crispy Lamb is one dish you should definitely try. It was brilliantly cooked and left me craving for more. The Classic Chicken Wings and Saigon Bowl Chicken are the other appetizers I ordered. Overall, the foodies cannot miss this place.                                                             
-                                            Went on an afternoon to have lunch when people with me were craving for good Chinese. The starters were smashing!! The signature chicken dish was chicken in a sauce on top of lettuce .. loved it. Fish was also great which I didn't taste but my wifey told. The main course gravy was chicken in black bean sauce with mushrooms which was above average. Overall a nice place to have good food. You might have to stand a lot to wait for ur Turn, so do be patient.                                                             
-                                            Mamagoto has dishes that are awesome both in its choice and its taste. They taste authentic and have an exciting array to choose from. The ambience is really good and definitely keeps making you come back for more.                                                            
-                                            I like trying out different cuisines all the time and so decided to come here and try some Asian food. Not for the first time though. Anyway, ambience is quite amazing with all these walls filled with posters, Chinese writings maybe and pictures, loved it. I had the Crispy Lamb which was quite good, the quantity was generous enough for two people. Then I had the Prawns wrapped in Bacon which was amazing. It was so good I could keep eating it all day ! I had never had the Thai Green Curry with Sticky Rice so decided to have that. Boy, I did not like it. Not because it was bad but because it tasted so authentic and original. If it tasted that original I think it ought to be actually good. Rice was actually very very sticky like it's name. I also had the Banoffie Pie which is definitely worth eating. I strongly recommend.  But overall amazing place, definitely worth going quite a few times.  If you can't digest authentic Asian food, you should think twice before coming here.                                                             
-                                            Yum is the word that springs to mind. Crispy lambs were awesome. The shakers are a must and pork belly with sticky rice was equally good. Next visit guranteed for tenderloin ðŸ˜‡                                                            
-                                            This is the fourth time I am coming and eating here. What stands out is the consistent quality and taste of the food.We ordered a pitcher of the watermelon caipiroska - 9/10Vegetable basil wraps - 8/10Crystal dumplings - 9/10Chicken noodles for my son. He loved it and ate about 3/4of the entire serving, so 10/10Spicy Bangkok bowl, which we tasted and I died in the arse from the spice. We sent it back with a request to make it less spicy, which they did. Special mention - Mammoth and Arnab who attended to us. Extremely helpful and courteous. Well done gents!-                                            It's a cool and cozy place to visit with friends.Booking is must as it is a very small place. But good things to try out here is batter fried squids and chicken baskets.                                                            
-                                            Food here is superlative. Service is great. Spent a great afternoon with friends over Sangria, Balinese noodles, and dumplingsðŸ˜Š We only tried vegetarian dishes but they were all good.                                                            
-                                            The guavagoto is my new favt cocktail..absolutely spot on. Street styled dumplings were to die for.thai chicken curry could have been more authentic in terms of taste and texture but it didn't taste bad at all.Decent ambience too defintelygoto mamagoto!!                                                            
-                                            By far the best Asian restaurant I have been too, way above Fatty 'shitty' bao.Went for my date, they floored us with their service and food.Sat at the bar, ordered for our drinks, saw it getting prepared on time.Immediately we finished our drinks we got our dinner table.Amazing food and flavoured liquor, the basil infused gin. Yummy                                                            
-                                            I had always wanted to go to mamagoto ever since my friend told me that the food is really good. And guess what? It did meet the expectations. I guess this is the best place in town for Asian food. It's a little expensive and the staffs are annoying at times. Apart from that the food and the place is really good.

-                                            2 visits within a month and I'm already craving more! Quirky ambience, friendly staff and finger licking food  makes me wanna give this place 2 thumbs up. Make sure you book a table in advance as the place is quite full (morning and evenings). Great variety of pan Asian cuisine with my fav being the Bangkok rice bowl with sticky rice (yummy). The cocktails are equally fun, though stay away from too much ice if ur as delicate as me. Had a sore throat with the ice they use on both occasions. We also had a little mix up when they served chicken instead of tofu to my vegetarian friend but they were quite prompt in correcting that mistake and apologised profusely. I would highly recommend a visit and you will come back for more ðŸ˜Š                                                            
-                                            This place is one of my personal favourite ! Not too flashy an ambience but nevertheless the place has a beautiful aura that keeps you lingering to it ! For non-vegs, it's a must recommended place ! The service is good and the food is finger licking tasty. They have pretty good choices when it comes to sea food ! Food is a bit pricy but nonetheless a must visit place :)                                                            
-                                            Mamagoto like it's name it's food is also very creative. We had only vegetarian food tonight. Dumplings were very good. Our soup was fantastic. Very decent and simple. Ambience was good the tables needed to be bigger. Pricing was not very reasonable. I would rate it as a must try restaurant.                                                             
-                                            Great experience. Been to this place quite sometime. The chicken starters always disappoints me. No much variety to order from and the chicken gravy very less quantity of gravy is served, it's more of chicken then the gravy.                                                              
-                                            The top places on my mind when I'm in Indiranagar!! Hands down.. This is the best place for Asian cuisine..!! Try the noodle based dishes!!!                                                            
-                    We are a big fan of pan-asian and Mamagoto was our go-to place for quite sometime. The place is expensive but we always felt that it is a price worth paid. However, our last visit left us with quite a bitter experience. We were a huge fan of the Smoked BBQ Pork sticky rice bowl and it became our comfort food. It was the sixth time I was there for this very same dish and being a rainy day I was really looking forward to it. However the pork that they served was so hard and dry that it was difficult to even bite on it. I asked our attendant to replace the dish, very courteously they took the dish back and promised to be back with a newly cooked one in another 20 minutes. My appetite was already gone but was feeling thankful for their effort. However the dish that they brought again had the very same problem. Either it was a bad cut of meat or it was left too long in BBQ. Further disappointing was the fact that they tried to convince us that that's how BBQ pork would be. Well I was having the same dish there for the 6th time!!! I paid a 800 bucks for this dish which didnt bring any taste to the palate and was just a waste. Even more the rice was just bland and no-sticky type at all and was smelling of just oil. I think the place is too expensive and when you get served with such bad dish, it makes it not worthy at all. I should have "Phobidden" myself that day. :P

-                                            Great place to sample Asian food! They have a fine mix of dishes from Singapore to Japan. Taste is very authentic.Place was super busy over the weekend. Ambience is colorful and fun. Not too expensive as well. . The food is great and the service even better! The cocktails don't disappoint either. There were mostly families or people on a dinner date. Go for the experience. Will definitely visit again!
