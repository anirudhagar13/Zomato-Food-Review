-                                            Ordered dal and paneer do pyaaza. No issues with service. Pricing is higher for curries, tastes good. Chana dal was properly cooked - flavoursome. Paneer was soft, a bit oily - thick gravy.                                                             
-                                            Pure punjabi food! All north indians who crave north indian food, this is the place to hit! The dal makhani and the paneer will take you to an other place. CHEESE BURST PARATHAS, yes you read that right. Cheese lovers, this exists and you have to give it a try. The lassi was out of this world as well. The service was fast and the food was delicious.                                                            
-                                            Nice place to have authentic punjabi food . I went to this resturent first time with lots of hope . The food was excellent taste . Ordered paratha , lassi , chass , thali . All the food taste was superb . The owner and staff are gentle and nice . They asked feedback for improvement of any dish they served . I recommend  friends to go and enjoy really tasty food .                                                            
-                                            Visited the place on Diwali day, the place was very crowded but the staff was courteous enough to help us find a seat for two. I could see the staff running about to keep pretty much every one happy. We ordered the dry fruit lassi, masala chaas and parathas. The staff reminded us that the qty of parathas might be too much for us and suggested ordering half of want we ordered and order again if required. Very thoughtful of the staff as we were visiting the place for the first time. The food was very delicious especially the parathas which were served with a large dollop of ghee! Definetly recommended for authentic punjabi food!                                                            
-                    I feel this place is a bit overrated. I have been wanting to visit this place since some time after reading raves on Zomato, but the place did not live up to the hype. First of all, it is more of a dhaba (a little more elegant maybe) than a caf√©. The place is located little inside the main road where you would not imagine it to be. It is an area where you might find a garage kind of a place, but it‚Äôs good that there is sufficient parking. The place has a rural touch. The Punjabi culture phrases on the walls make it very interesting; I especially enjoyed reading the ‚Äòfun facts about punjabis‚Äô more so because being a Punjabi I could relate to most of these. So ambience wise it is a decent Punjabi place to be in.But I was disappointed with the food which was way too spicy and oily than it should have been. I know Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich gravies and flavor, but this one was low on flavor and it was just too oily and a lot spicy taking it to the unhealthy side. The alloo jeera in my thali was undercooked and the butter paneer masala was just high on masalas. The green chutney was watery. Alloo parantha was a little better in that sense, with good and proper filling but I felt if you are serving one parantha in the range of Rs 50-100, it better come with curd at least or we should get an option of getting curd instead of butter.I have been to a lot better Punjabi restaurants in Bangalore serving authentic food and at lower prices than this one, but seems like there is a dearth of such places in this area which is why this one is thriving!

-                                            This would be one of the closest to a dhaba all the way south in Bangalore. The mishti dahi was heavenly and so was the poori chole. The food is true value for money and the taste has an authentic feel to it. The seating is at best casual but the service and smiling staff make the place pleasant.                                                             
-                                            Delicious Punjabi food. Loved the food, simple ambience, background old Punjabi pop songs and aloo de paranthe.It is definitely nice North Indian place in Bangalore.We ordered aloo parantha, gobi parantha, khasta parantha, all tasted so good. They serve it in Punjabi style with lots of butter :PBeing an ardent fan of Punjabi food we ordered kadhi pakoda and rice also. But it was a slight disappointment, can be improved.For desert we ordered fruit cream, it was too good and lassi was mindblowingly great.Overall it was a fun evening eating awesome food and listening to old Punjabi daler mahendi songs :)-                                            Ordered kadhai paneer and rotis from here. The paneer was awesome. Really spicy and hot. I have had this dish before in a different kapoor's cafe but this was way better. I will definitely be ordering from here again. One dish was barely enough for one eater.                                                             
-                                            The place has nothing to flaunt for, no good food and worst ambience and infrastructure. And its overrated and highly priced. They should atleast improve the food quality.                                                            
-                                            Perfect place to taste some good and spicy north Indian food. Ambience adds flavor to it. I feel it is little over priced but worth going if you are a fan Punjabi food. You will get good burps after having food here. Buttermilk and lassi are worth trying..really like the way they serve it in "Kulhad".                                                            
-                                            Authentic Punjabi restaurant. it has come up with a new outlet which is great as this is always overcrowded. Must try  cheese pataka balls for starters.                                                            
-                                            This is an awesome place to hang out. Foods are delicious and available in awesomely low prices.  Ambience is not too great but who cares when u get such food!! Lassi is must try here.                                                            
-                                            At last was able to go to this place. A great punjabi restaurant . Best part is it is vegüëç.. loved the food , the parathas were awesome just loved it. In case you are not a fan of butter , do let the waiters know that you donot want butter or else the parathas will drip in butter. Loved the lassi.. they have a nice system of paying the bill where you have to go to the cashier to pay, he will read the bill and you pay. I felt it gave it more of a human touch. the only thing that I thought could be better was the seating.                                                             
-                                            Visited the place thrice and never got disappointed.Ambiance is not that great, but you will definitely fall in love with the food. Dhaba style with authentic punjabi taste. Highly overcrowded....Kheer must try!!!!                                                            
-                                            Kapoor's Cafe It was a authentic Punjabi cuisine with local Desi infrastructure. Didn't expect the crowd, yet it was weekend crowd was much. Menu has Complete punjabi items like breakfast and meal. Ordered one Combo meal, Gobi Parata, Dry fruit Lassi, Pepsi Masala soda and Assorted starter. Everthing was on time, Hot served. Combo was something intresting with all types of items in the plate. Dry fruit Lassi was so tasty.                                                             
-                                            Nice plaxe for breakfast or brunch. Good desi veg punjabi food. Lassi, aloo paratha, chole, dal puris were good. paneer pakora, kheer, bhatura were average. Music system should be improved as we could hardly hear the songs. Light on the pocket and clean as well. Worth atleast a visit.                                                            
-                                            ordered food for home delivery paneer do payaza mushroom masala n few parathas... to be honest parsthas was the only thing which was edible.. there was ton of oil dripping down from the box which had to be seprated out. curries had way too much masala... on the whole shitty food not recommended.                                                             
-                                            Being a North indian I was searching for dhaba style food in Bangalore and then Kapoor‚Äôs Cafe came to the rescue. I ordered many dishes. Really loved the parathas and lassi but i was disappointed with Matra Kulcha. Matra was undercooked and watery. Will surely want to revisit this place specially for the stuffed parathas.                                                            
-                                            If you do not know the place and visiting for the 1st time just follow the map or you will be lost..the entrance looks like you are at a dhaba but the ambience is decent...lassi served in a matka with flavour of kesar must have...the best cheese pakodas..mutter paratha was a bit spicy n so filling...kadai paneer was good...the oaneer pulav was a bit oily...heard the fruit Cream is the best desert but we tried the shahi tukda instead and it was good with little less sweet..on yhw whole a good experience                                                             
-                    If you want to have a dhaba kinda taste and without much driving, here's the place within city limits. The only difference you would find from regular dhabas is this place doesn't remain open after 11pm. Located in a small lane after varthur itpl signal with no roads and a deserted parking. Simple table chair seating arrangement. Clean hygienic place, neat kitchen. What else you need from a dhaba like place.Let's talk about food - delicious food, nice portions, served hot. And the best part is it is PURE VEG. Way to go VEGANs. Cheese pakoda balls are simply finger licking. French Fries Punjabi style are truly Funjabi. Added falvors like chat masala and chilli powder, decorated with fried green chillies. Masala papad is also very tasty though papad is very tiny in size. Pudina khasta paratha is good. Aloo Paratha (with butter, Punjabi portion) rocks. Chilli Onion paratha is the only disappointing dish we had. Fulkas are good. Malai kofta, rajma and paneer lababdar - tasty and delicious. Though would advise to have spicy paneer like butter masala or kadai paneer. Jeera rice is usual.Buttermilk is tasty. Lassi rocks, deserves for repeat order. Dry fruit lassi is very subjective as it contains too much of cashews and almonds.Sometime bit slow in service, but mostly prompt service. That may be the only reason for no to 5* rating.

-                                            The most over-hyped restaurant in Whitefield.Really poor food quality...they're not capable of handling the huge influx of crowd usually seen during weekends. The whole place stinks of fat Punjabi dudes sweating and salivating...with one eye on the "Soni kudi" waiting outside and other eye on their mobile phone...while loudly reciting the menu card...it's like Navjot Singh Siddhu x 100 .The owner, like any other Punjabi guy...hardly care about the mismanaged situation ...and has a very casual approach to any situation ( Saw some dudes fighting outside...and when informed about it...the owner just said "O jee...unko keh do thand rakho" )                                                             
-                                            Authentic Punjabi parantha, taste, spices, ambience and kind of flavours used. If you are looking for punjabi parantha, Veg north indian food this is the best place in and around Whitefield. A must visit place and bit crowded during weekends. It is recommened to come bit early to avoid rush. We ordered almost all types of paranthas - alu, gobhi, mix, khasta, Cheese, cheese burst and paneer. Cheese parantha is a must try as you will not find it easily in another places. Do try matka Lassi with added kesar.                                                            
-                                            I have been here for first time with high expectations after reading reviews. To start with good i liked lassi and khasta paratha, though lassi was too sweet by any standard. We ordered Paneer butter masala with no butter/ cream and almost tasteless; worst was the dhaba daal, which was stale and smelly. Also the place is too noisy, if you want a peaceful eve. So overall my experience with the place has been very bad for the first time.üëé                                                            
-                                            If you love authentic Punjabi food then this is the place for you. Awesome rajma and cheese paratha. Great ambience. Friendly staff and Punjabi songs. A must go place.                                                            
-                                            Bang on spot for authentic Punjabi food. My roommate and I head on to Kapoor's whenever we have the sudden urge to have aloo paratha. Their aloo pyaaz paratta is brilliant with generous serving of butter. We have also tried their khasta paratha, paneer paratha, three cheese paratha, phulka with desi ghee, pindi Chole, chaas, lassi.. Personal favorite : aloo pyaaz paratha and chaas. Always.The only drawback I see is that the place shuts at 3pm and then opens up at 7pm. It would be amazing if the place is open throughout the day. VFM : 4.5/5Hygiene: 4/5Food Quality : 4/5Food Quantity : 4/5-                                            Awesome food and awesome service. I am definitely their permanent customer when it comes to punjabi food. Would recommend this place to anyone.

North Indian parathe da experience for first time in Bangalore. Great to have your outlet near my residence!! Chaa gaye ji tusi chaa gaye!! Shukriya hai ji!!                                                            
-                                            Being a punjabi, and a foodie, life was difficult in Bangalore until I came across Kapoor's Cafe. The place reeks of punjab! The place is built in a shed kind of a place with flowers and plants. It reminded me of a garden seating. The hosts and servers were warm and accomodating. Seating was not particularly comfortable though. But the place looked good overall.It was the food that stole my heart. The food was amazing. Everything tasted wonderful. The lassi and chhaach both were spot on. The Aloo Parantha was drool worthy! The cheese balls were yummy. The mozzarella parantha was calorie laden but worth it. Shahi tukda is something they can strike off their menu. But the food was amazing. I would personally recommend this place if you are looking for authentic punjabi food in Bangalore! Great job guys!                                                            
-                                            Small place and comfortable. Taste is good but in every items we ordered they provided panner. Probably waiter should mention that you are ordering panner in all items. Best is Kadi item along with Lassi.                                                            
-                                            I ordered  food today through swiggy order no 1069121976. Ordered 3 khasta parathas jeera rice shai paneer and dhabha dal. The food was really disappointing. Paneer was soacked in oil parathas were raw on sides   dal was watery and rice was of bad quality small and sticky. I doubt if the food really came from the restaurant . I am in brookfield. Requesting management to check the order.  There was no branding on the food continers and no printed bill was provided.  Yhe good was delayed as well. The delivery person said the delay was from restaurant.
