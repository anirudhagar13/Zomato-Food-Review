-                                            It is a Rajasthani cuisine restaurant in JP Nagar Bangalore and I recently got to visit it with my cousins. We usually eat few of the Marwari Meals in the restaurants but in here the varieties were endless. Like the dal bati cooked in ghee was really something and the Jalebi Rasmalai too. You won‚Äôt be able to cover the menu in 2-3 visits as well and visiting again, it is quite an extensive thali.                                                            
-                                            A place to relish authentic rajathani cuisine. Ambience - royal, lots of traditional architecture giving a Rajasthan feeling. Perfect blending with meals. Service - servers are prompt, makes your meal pleasurable. Food - We have been twice to this place - would love to keep coming back. We have tried couple of dishes and each one with perfect spice levels and yet authentic.                                                            
-                                            We went here on a Sunday for family lunch. Indeed, the ambience was really authentic just like what we saw photos of, but when it came down to the food and service, it wasn't up to the mark. Having Rajasthani roots, the food was rather disappointing with the jalebi and rabri being the saving grace. A one time visit.                                                             
-                                            Ambiance is super cool. Food was bit ok, it was just that we could not try much. I would rate this place about 4 for the food. People are really assistive and explain well about the items they serve.                                                              
-                                            Excellent ambience all around, authentic Rajasthani style tasty dishes on a silver platter, not too crowded on a weekday for lunch, overall very good.                                                             
-                                            Liked this place for an excellent spread of varieties. Be it with sweet, spicy or tangy, they have all flavors, unlike other Rajasthani outlets. Almost everything was tasty and satisfied the taste buds and stomach.                                                            
-                                            We went here for our family gathering...  Amazing spread of both appetizers and main course...  We were delighted to have it in silver plated! Very well maintained, tasty and variety food.. All my family members loved it..  It was fun!!                                                              
-                                            The ambience is the most appealing . They have a decor of old classical times and the service is great because of the friendly staff . Being a south Indian , I don't quite know all the dishes so they explain to you about each one of them and it's how it's made . The food is quite filling actually. It's better if you are REALLY hungry to enjoy all the dishes available on the buffet . Taste was pretty good.                                                             
-                                            The taste of food is very average...the ambience is just OK....except for the fact that they serve in silver plates and bowl.....the menu there is very monotonous as compared with Rajdhani food....                                                            
-                                            Celebrated my cousin‚Äôs reunion last week. We all being marwaris enjoyed the delicacies with utmost pleasure. Being away from home it was true taste of Rajasthan in heart of Bangalore. A nice getaway memory with my cousins.                                                            
-                                            Had a meal like a king and was served like one. Enjoyed all dishes thor-oughly. From starters to desserts, it‚Äôs a yummylicious experience. Being a pure vegetarian it was a delight.                                                            
-                                            Really bad experience, a fellow customer found a cockroach in the Dal Bhati. Left the place immediately! Be aware! What a shame. The ambience was good and we were on starters which were also good.                                                             
-                                            Kesariya is nice traditional restaurant where food is served in a huge thali. The meal starts with a huge variety of snacks and welcome drink followed by main course and dessert. Ideal place to visit with friends and family.                                                            
-                                            A vegetarian‚Äôs paradise. The chaat festival is too good to be missed. Loved the doll display, had read about it but never got a chance to see it. A pleasurable visit. Looking forward to my next visit.                                                            
-                                            Such an amazing soothing place , I never thought kesariya had such a beautiful peaceful restaurant, very nice n clam ambiance they have. For the first time I had my dinner with rajasthani song in the background never thought it would be so good.They have good variety in thali with chat live counter . Starting from welcome drinks to deserts , I felt almost everything's tasted very good real rajasthani authentic food. Service is at its best. Definitely recommend this place and would considers visiting this place again.                                                            
-                                            We expected a lot from Kesariya restaurant, they had a great ambience, but the food was no where close to being good.Starters were too many, but served in very small quantities. Main course was hardly noticeable.It was one-off a bad experience.                                                            
-                                            It was OK...... Not worth the money at all...... Would not visit again or recommend to anyone....... Service was not that great.............                                                             
-                                            'Kesariya balam aao ni, padharo mhare des'. This runs through your head when you enter the ambiance. Since reserved early on Zomato, we didn't had to wait much.Being on occasion of Dusshera it was jam packed. The mild Kesar aroma fills you into a soothe.The chats being served as starters were good. It included Papdi chaat, Katori chaat and many more.Food served was quite hot and fresh. No negatives on it. The only drawback today was the Service. Being a full house on festival day might be taken into consideration.-                                            Horrible experience! Came here with family only to be served for over 3 hours. We actually had to walk into the kitchen and ask for food. Terrible experience. I recommend you never come here.                                                             
-                                            Loved the entire experience. Good food, well mannered and informed staff, a pleasant ambience has me recommending this place to everyone who I know loves good, authentic food. :D                                                            
-                                            Absolutely wonderful experience.The food is great. They don't run through the serving.Ample time to enjoy all the available varieties.Ambience is great as well.                                                            
-                                            As soon as you enter the first thing you feel good is the ambience which has subtle royal touch. The staff are very cooperating. The silver thalis adds to the ambience.Its mainly Rajastani cuisine. Each dish name is told by the staff. At least there are more than 30 variety.I specially liked salad chats green chutney baby corn pakoda black channa curry imli juice sweets n dum biryani . The food is really filling n you will definitely find yourself loaded.Apart from food nice place to sit n spend time with your family or friends. The staff are extremely cooperating n helpful.                                                            
-                                            My family was looking for a nice, quiet Vegetarian place for dinner, and we came across Kesariya in zomato. Kesariya is located in JP Nagar, in the same building as Bresky Pub. This place has the sweeeetest interiors, very nice ambience and the staff was so friendly too. As soon as we entered and got seated, they advised us to try out the chaat section. The aloo tikki chaat and Papdi chaat were absolutely delicious. One of the best chaats I've ever had. After that, for starters, We had bhajji with various chutneys, and some salad. For main course, They served us the proper Rajasthani cuisine with my favoriteee Dal bhati churma! And they ended it with some yummy Kulfi. Taste was impeccable, service was amazing and I loved everything about this place. What's more, they serve their food in silver plates ! üëë-                                            Nice place, Nice interior  üòç nice presentation . But the food is not worth the money (500) .Food taste was not as expected ,Was disappointing a little. Me and my friends had been there to enjoy the rajasthani  food , it was good but not the best . U can try it once but it's expensive .                                                            
-                                            The food was amazing, but a bit of salt and sugar variations, I and my sister like the food and especially some items we became total fida. Ambience was great and so were the staff's hospitality.All in all great experience.                                                             
-                                            Had a lot of expectations from this place. The decor is lavish and a little overwhelming. We therefore chose to sit on the terrace which was a little more casual. Service was good..the waiters are trained to over-serve you and push you to eat more. Food-wise..it was an average meal. The dishes ticked all the boxes but flavour was missing. Nothing really stood out. Won't be back here.                                                             
-                                            Loved the ambience and the food . Their speciality is typical Rajasthani food served in silver thali. The dal baati and the subzi was really good. Overall a must visit place for thali lovers.. From starters to main course, it‚Äôs surely a yummylicious experience. You just cannot stop eating. Authentic food away from home.                                                            
-                                            Very Polite and courteous staff. Hygienic and Quality food. A true Rajasthani Cuisine. Starters, sweets are the best of the lot. Don't forget to have pan after lunch.                                                            
-                                            A place for true rajasthani delicacy... Staff: polite and helpingAmbience: Awesome..The hall looks like a typical darbaar with shrinathji's paintings all over.. Food: The food was great with lots of variety... The Daaal baati was okay.. The daal was not like a typical rajasthani daal... kadhi was awesome... The only thing missing was ker-saangri... rest everything was great...Would love to visit again... worth the money.                                                            
-                                            The way food is served is very royal. The ambiance also takes you to the good old days. The food served is too much and cannot enjoy the entire range.                                                            
-                                            Had been for dinner. Great ambience and if you have sweet tooth, worth to visit once. I would prefer visiting it for lunch party than dinner                                                             
-                                            If you are looking for a sumptuous Thali, this is the perfect place in South Bangalore. I would rate it higher than Rajdhani, both for food and service. Make sure you try a little of all dishes, as they have a huge menu and it just keeps on coming. Lovely ambience too.                                                             
-                                            When you are lazy enough to walk to get the items in buffet, when you are bored of eating south Indian food, when you crave to eat authentic cuisines of some other state then you shall walk into these kind of Thali restaurants which are there across Bengaluru. There are plenty of Rajasthani Thali restaurants like Rajdhani, Rasovara, Kesariya to name a few.Unlike Rajdhani where they force you to eat nonstop and get out, here they don't even ask you for the second serving (except rotis) unless you call them and they are not very generous in serving. Ambiance is good, pricing is on the higher side as you will get huge spread in many veg buffets restaurants for the same it lesser price but yes it's good when compared to other Rajasthani Thali restaurants.                                                            
-                                            Wow this is one kinda place which can change your mood instantly. What an interior and ambience. Some food items were not up to the mark in taste but ignorable. Truly Rajasthani food.                                                             
-                                            A rajasthani thali place with courteous and quick service.  We were served in silver ware and the variety of food served was amazing. The starters like the peas kachori, pyaaz pakoda and the quintessential dal bati were very good. The vegetable curries like papad ki sabzi, and shikanji-pakodi were good too but we really enjoyed the desserts, especially the moong dal halwa and kheer!I think it is better than the Rajdhani chain outlets in terms of service and food quality.
