-                                            Average.!! Could do a lot better. Might get really loud during the weekend. Choice of items in the menu is good but they really have to work on the taste.

-                                            The ambience and the way the serve ,the utensil they use were really good .The ambience and the outside part of the hotel will definitely pull u in . We tried the tamatar vadi ka shorba the flavours that has been added to it made the shorba a really good one .For the staters we had lucknowi dahi ki shammi and challi komi kebab , the lucknowi dahi ki shammi was really good it had a very gud flavour of ginger mixed in yoghurt . Being a vegetarian we did not find the challi komi kebab appetizing it looked like a chicken lollipop and we were not able to get any flavours .Shahi subz daalcha was really good and kathiawari tarkari wasnt really great we paired it with butter rotis . And finally we had ghee rice with kachumber (raita) it was good .Ambience :4.5/5Service :4.5/5Food :3.5/5                                                            
-                                            A drive through a busy narrow lane finally led me to this mughlai place.. the restaurant was roomy as well as airy with well done interiors! It was surprisingly empty for a Saturday evening though.. The neat and tidily maintained restaurant was quite prompt when it came to service. Their signature starter tasted pretty good whereas the main course, which arrived in no time was rich and wholesome! The captain, Deepchand, kept enquiring if I was satisfied with the food, which was appreciable, as did the steward Brijay, who was really courteous.. A unique styled menu with authentic mughlai names and importantly good grub that seemed a welcome change amongst the numerous restaurants that have recently come up without much quality or service...One noticeable thing was the presentation of their dishes..innovative!                                                            
-                                            Starting with the ambience which is top notch! We got enough privacy for a good cousins only dinner Have to really appreciate the way they serve lassi which is really wonderful but the only problem with that is I find the quantity quite less I would grade my experience on the staff for a 6 on ten Otherwise this is a place that is worth checking out The food takes some time to arrive

-                                            On request of there manager mr vivek we visited this place which is located on best possible point in koramangla.They are pinor on the way what they do with food and are best at what they do.I love the way there ambience is done you need to experience yourself rather than going through the review.Service is such a great experience and a treat to everything.They way they serve food in those trucks and the lassi my favourite was kesari lassi.Food is just mind blowing and it allows you to be nostalgic in every bite.Everything has a story to tell.-                    Being new to bangalore and to zomato i really wanted to try some good north indian food.but sorry to say was dissapointed in it @ kopper kadai.Good thing was the presentation of food,ambience and service.Bad thing was such a lound noise of customer,flavours of food mostly bland,Major concentration is given on presentation and quantity of food rather than quality of food.Soup dal e danhiya it cant be considered soup its more like a dal preparation (average).-                        Being new to bangalore and to zomato i really wanted to try some good north indian food.but sorry to say was dissapointed in it @ kopper kadai.Good thing was the presentation of food,ambience and service.Bad thing was such a lound noise of customer,flavours of food mostly bland,Major concentration is given on presentation and quantity of food rather than quality of food.Soup dal e danhiya it cant be considered soup its more like a dal preparation (average).-                                            I would rate this restaurant 3/5 stars .service was very bad they took almost 20 mins to just serve starters and again another 15 mins for the mains . When it comes to the food , it was average . Had ordered butter chicken which was too sweet for my taste , the chicken Malai Kabab was hard . Disappointed.                                                            
-                                            I loved the ambiance more than anything else, but it'd be unfair if I didn't mention the variety of food they had to offer. To start with the sugarcane chicken was something I never had tasted before and something you'd end up loving too. The staff is very supportive and quick on toes. Would love to go there again . The presentation is something worth noticing.                                                             
-                                            Went to this place for a team outing place after trusting the review on zomato, but the overall experience was not at all good. Firstly they hardly had any options in starters, main course or deserts and also the taste of most of the items was not good.                                                            
-                                            Service at the restaurant was very slow.. food was also not that great.. Very less vegetarian options..  serving style is little fascinating                                                            
-                                            Fabulous place to halt for meal. They have their buffet and alakarte as well. The food is delicious and the presentation is brilliant. A big thumbs up to this place                                                             
-                                            Best northindian joint in Koramangla 5th block.Love the ambience,food and service.Menu is quite compact.A very unique presentation style and quite beautiful served too.Lassi on small truck.Chicken on sword.Smoked chass.Bill in letterbox.-                                            Good Ambience and nice music....One thing that stood out was the mode of presentation associated while serving dishes...see photos...keshariya lassi came in a miniature truck...starters were awesome...especially veg...challi kolmi kabab is a must try...along with takatak paneer tikka...They are best in town..main course was good...dal e dastaan was rich and delicious...overall pricing is on the higher side...                                                            
-                                            I really liked the way this restaurant serves the food.It's really innovative.The theme of the restaurant is royal/elite + ethnic.So we went there and got the table immediately,but there was a long wait to get water served in our glasses (which I didn't like).Then after along wait, they provided complementary papad and chutney in a really unique kind of stand with small kadais.I was not very hungry so ordered harey Masale key kofte. It was good, and was prepared nicely.it was not very spicy or bland but made me feel it has been cooked at home.Overall I would say more than food I liked the ambiance and the way of serving food.In the end, you will be surprised with a postbox to give you the bill.                                                            
-                    This review is a tad late. Had been to this place 2-3 months ago, when it was newly opened. The experience was so drastic, that we walked out just after being served our starters.So here goes, on reading rave reviews about this place, we decided to visit the place instead of our usual dine out which is the same segment as this place in Koramangala. We got a table with much difficulty for a later slot our dinner time, but we were excited about this place but it was a small glitch.we were welcomed with very warm staff at the entrance and then the captain escorted to our table. Wow, the smells and smoke in the place is unbelievable. and not in a good way. I mean someone with a cold or sinus can be cured here, the burning charcoal and the smell of food is very over powering.And if that was not enough the bills were coming in medium sized post boxes, food on small cart wheels/ charpouy, miniature looking tandoor, water was served in goblets, food was sizzling out of the kitchen...i mean imagine the setup, all this chaos and people chattering away...coz the noise reduction is quite bad. You can hear every word being spoken at the next table. So my end impression, was that a food stylist had puked all over the restaurant.Our starters arrived which was a portion of Paneer for the poor vegetarian being me and Chicken Kabab for the kids and hubby. paneer was the usual affair where you can't complain much but wasn't anything special either. However when the chicken came out of the skewers, my husband actually gasped in horror. There were 5 thin strips of boneless chicken which is no condition would have sufficed as a portion for 2 adults, or 2 kids and a adult.-                        This review is a tad late.

-                                            We visited this place last week for our Team lunch and I would like to rate this place as Average since value for money is less.Pros:Good AmbienceMain course was good(Mutton , Chicken , Rice ...)Welcome drink was goodCons:Starters were less in numbers(3 Veg , 3 Non Veg)Chicken starterwas not cooked wellSoup was served coldDeserts options are very less.(Negligible ) and they were not at all tasty.Dahi bada was pathetic.Veg starters paneer tikka was tasteless.Overall I feel in the same price Absolute Barbeque is much better option.                                                            
-                                            This review is quite late. I just love this place. The food is yummy. The pics I will be posting says all the story. I will keep visiting to experiment with the dishes. Prices are bit on the higher side but no compromising with the quality of food they serve.                                                             
-                                            Great Ambience, the concept of the restaurant looks good and feels great.Food presentation was brilliant.Customer Service is good as well. However, we had hard time communicating with few of the staff.Food taste was average, which was disappointing in a way since we expected better based on price, ambience and presentation. There was a lot of masala which put few of the friends off.Maybe a one off day for them, give it a try if you are into very spicy food.                                                            
-                                            After going through so much of review on zomato.i wanted to try @ this place so i gave a try and with all i agree.I have experienced both in a day.Food left me with mix feelingOption of vegetarian compare to non vegetarianFood of a particular taste bud and all.Service,valet,ambienceBut one thing which was to be noted was the effort they put.Busy night service team put 100%to make my experience.Kitchen team tried to rectify food according to my palate.-                                            Top notch Punjabi food, big flavors, exciting dishes, amazing service didn't make me miss the alcohol. We were a group of 6 and we just stuffed ourselves with all the different kinds of starters and they were all amazing. The valet situation is not sorted out and we had trouble getting the cars on time.                                                            
-                                            This was a wonderful experience. Really loved the decor- it was quirky and fun. The food was presented in a unique way and we would definitely come back. We enjoyed the food as well, there was really nothing that did not match up to our expectations! So overall very good experience.                                                             
-                                            Good about this place is its ambience,starters and service.Ambience is beautiful.Food is mild spicy fit for my palate as i like my food to be towards less spicy but its only on my taste buds.Service is promt and curteous.

-                                            Try this place if you want to have good food with awesome presentation and good ambience and service.This restaurant is quite a awesome place to dine in.Visited here last Friday quite occupied restaurant.                                                            
-                                            So everyone who has zomtoed this place would know this is a popular  place known for its decor and location.Well at first you will be intrigued by the copper ness decor everywhere and the fancy lightings and the over crowdedness(making you feel oh this is such an awesome place). Don't be too happy as this is not the place for your taste budsHailing from Delhi you are always excited to go to a Mughlai restaurant hoping the flavours would savour your taste.We order kk shikanji which was terrible and fancy at the same time. For starters we ordered the famous Lucknowi galouti which was basically bland and uncooked. We returned the dish and ordered the chicken tikka which was just okay.For main course we ordered nalli mutton which was way too oily and taste was okay too.In all didn't feel like ordering dessert to be let down more.Price: ₹₹₹₹Food:2.5/5Ambiance:3/5-                                            Servers great north Indian food but it's a very expensive place. Ambience is good, But the service was really bad. We had to wait for food for almost an hour and that too we had to remind them to get the food. Biryani was served first then the curry and then the rotis. By the time we got the rotis food was qll cold. Had a really bad experience at the place.                                                             
-                                            Punjabi cuisine, beautiful ambiance, extremely comfortable seating and courteous staff. These r the positives. We ordered :mal mal chicken - just alright, not so mal mal Palak soup - good Garlic naan -good Chicken tikka masala - not in the menu, wasn't great Daal - don't remember which one, was fine.

Initial thoughts were excitement from reading all the reviews right here. But honestly, my experience was nowhere close to being that great.As soon as we walked in, we were given a welcome drink. It was a khatta mango drink, aam panna like, with what seemed like grated coconut on top. This was very refreshing.

Startars are very bad there are no more items, they give only 2 chicken startarsComing to main course 1 chicken curry and 1 mutton curry and there is no non-veg rice item in that main course are also not that much good. For non- veg buffet it is not good option compare to buff buffet   buff and other restaurant  this rating is for buffet and manager, that manager said that we won't get same buffet outside than we said it's compared to other restaurant in koramangla you are zero but he didn't agree and he said that they are the best in the market.  And hopefully i like to inform the people don't go for buffet food in kapad kadai it is really waste of money i would like to suggest u 1 more restaurant in koramangla buff buffet buff go there friends u'll get 20 startars and u'll get varieties of main course and dessert.
