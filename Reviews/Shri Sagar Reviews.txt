-                                I personally feel it's overrated place but nonetheless it's good place to have the benne masala dosa. It's usually crowded most of the time and one has to wait for good 15-20mins to get a place. The size of the dosa has drastically reduced over the period since it shot to fame. I soo wish it becomes the same CTR it used to be 10 yrs back
-                Went to this place as I went to meet one of my frndz who stays near ms ramaiah  college... Read many reviews as well as recommendations from people I follow in this platform, had to stand for around 15 mins to get a seat was so jam packed... Ordered benne masala dosa must say they have perfected the art of how to make a dosa fluffy inside yet super crunchy outside was served with 2 chutneys the masala wasnt very spicy enuf btw and was loaded with ghee so if someone whozzz a health freak myt just think twice .... Anyways one of the best I tasted, den asked for mangalore bajji but was out of stock so tried their puri and kesari bath Which again was full of pure ghee.. It was also too good... Den tried their rava idly Which I must say that it was Nothing extra ordinary to be mentioned about and lastly finished off with a cuppa of coffee Which again was decent not very strong so a hardcore coffee lover may not rate it too much on the higher scale.... But anyways a very good place nevertheless

-                                Again this find was based on Zomato and thank God for it. We had the pleasure of eating the best Upma here and later at MTR. Madly crowded, you have to almost stand on the head of people already eating. Sadly, that's the only way you would manage a table.Then, there are no menus and the only display menu on a wall was in Kannada which again didn't help. So had to ask the waiter what all was available. Idli wasn't but Upma and Masala Dosa was, so that was it and loved both.The Upma can not be softer and better while the Dosa is small, light but crisp. Sadly, you have to ask for Sambhar, that too would be served in very little quantity. Apparently, they don't want to get into serving it with so many people around. Had the Filter Coffee to end the meal and went more crazy.Missed Sambhar badly but loved the food. And, it is super cheap.
-                We are not from these parts and had been negligently oblivious of the existence of this iconic place. That was destined to change one evening as were driving to Mantri Square Mall and saw this old looking building and were quite curious to know why so many people were standing inside and at the entrance door. A few google searches later, we decided that we just have to come here. We parked at the mall and walked to this place, soaking in the ambience of the streets of Malleshwaram. We finally reached and it was an amazing atmosphere despite all the crowds and the chaos. A few minutes of struggle later, we found ourselves sharing the table with another party. No menus here and everyone seemed to know what to order. We didn't and the only kannada menu on the wall by the counter didn't help either. The friendly waiter suggested in part kannada and part sign language and we exchanged the magical words of Dosa and Kaapi and that was taken care of. A few minutes later, the famous Benne Dose arrived. A small dosa, it was both thick and crisp and the filling was super tasty. One bite and we knew what we had been missing all these decades. The 2 chutneys- Pudina and normal coconut were also ever so tasty. We literally devoured the dosa in minutes and washed it down with an excellent filter coffee.CTR- you have added new fans and we would come here as often as we can.​

-                                Being Bangalore's one of the renowned places had very high expectations to have exceptional dosas.  Only my disappointment was high. After waiting for around 20mins for a table, the waiter had no interest to take our orders. Got us half the stuffs n forgot a few. The dosa was just as average as you find at any dosa outlet around. The kara bhath was tasteless rava with some salt n seasoning added jus for heck of it. Rava idli was even worse. The only tasty dish was kesari bhath. Would prefer Siddanna or umesh dosa camp any day over this place.
-                                Shiv Sagar or more famously known as CTR is my Bangalore favorite. Their Benne Dosa's are simply simply amazing. I really gape at their ability to make a thick Dosa crispy! Must be the copious amounts of butter, bht hey, I'm not complaining. I had the plain Benne Dosa and also the Mysore Masala (which comes with the red chutney and Masala inside the Dosa). And I'm always in bliss after eating here. Loved it!  And will keep coming back for more!
-                                The best dosas this side of the Equator, and they don't make dosas on the other side. If I was in prison on death row, this dosa would be part of my last meal. If I was stuck on a desert island and could have only one thing to eat, this dosa would be it. I haven't really eaten anything else at CTR. But their benne masala dosa and filter coffee will make you weep with joy at how good a dosa can be. To all the Vidyarthi Bhavan lovers out there: CTR is better. Sean Paul even sang a song about Vidyarthi Bhavan's jealousy, called 'VB burning'.
-                Probably one of the best dosa's you can lay your hands on! Located in the busy streets of Malleshwaram and has been one amongst the oldest serving restaurants still serving our heritage on a plate! Ctr is typically known for its yummy Benne Masala Dosa's. It had been ages since I had visited ctr and today finally got a chance to visit it again. The place is open till 12:30 in the afternoon and we were right on time. Even though it was not a typical breakfast time, it was still pretty crowded. The interiors are normal and a bit congested but who cares as long as the food at the end of the day is great! Ctr has 2 floors for seating so you can find quite a number of tables to sit at. Since it was closing time and waiter insisted us to order everything at once, we went ahead and ordered their specialties 1. Benne Masala Dosa: Really crispy dosa's @cause of the butter that is added to it. Served alongside the normal coconut chutney and then a Pudina chutney. Every bite of the Dosa, you get that wonderful taste of the butter. Who doesn't love butter? The dosa's are relatively small and could easily have 2 of them at once. The potato pulya was also yummy and I would gladly say it was something which everyone in Bangalore should try! 2.Coffee: Normal Strong Filter coffee which we had to end the yummy meal! The servers are quite nice and comfortable to talk to  and Each dosa is like 50 bucks which is really good for the quality we get. An amazing place and will keep visiting as in when I can!

-                                A totally vintage dosa place situated perfectly in the cradle of old Bengaluru. This place will give you the feel of old school and those vintages interiors leaving you nostalgic.! I feel guilty of not visiting even after being in Blore for so long.! You are absolutely not a true Bangalorean if you haven't eaten at this place. So I finally dawned my outcast status and ventured her for a gastronomical journey with my fiancé.! We had a rava idli, their trademark bene (butter) masala dosa, plain bene dosa and filter coffee (can't do without this). Trust me your visit to this place is incompetent w/out having their bene masala dosa. Honestly, the rava idli was not so great but the dosas were piping hot, crispy and glazing (because of the butter). I really haven't had such delicious dosa before.! Would certainly keep going to the place :)
-                CTR the most popular and the oldest South Indian fast food restaurant. Located in the most iconic area of Bangalore, the Malleshwaram. I visited the place on a weekday for breakfast, it was the office crowd who were there for a quick grab in the ground floor and rest casual diners in the first floor. It's an old building located at the corner of a street. The ambience is pleasant, cultural, historical, rustic and busy. Their bestseller is the Masala Dosa, for which the restaurant has won numerous awards.   I ordered the famous Benne Masala Dosa, Poori, Idli, Vada and Coffee.   Started off the breakfast with quick bites of Idli and Vada. They were served with Coconut Chutney and Sambar. The Vada is deep fried, crispy outside and soft, moist, crumbly inside. The crunch sound while taking bite gives all the pleasure in the world. The sweet and sour sambar is a great accompaniment along with the vada.    The Idlis are steamed and thus super soft. It's crumbly, fermented, fresh, hot, light, moist and flavourful. The Chutney has a salty, spices and grated coconut flavour.The Benne Masala Dosa is served with Potato Palya and Pudina and Coconut Chutney. The Dosa is thick, cooked with some extra butter and looks Mouthwatering. The outside is rigid, crispy and shallow fried to deep brown colour, while the inside is soft, crumbly and moist. The Dosa was well cooked and tastes Divine with the accompaniments.   Poori is served with Coconut Chutney and Vegetable Saagu. The Pooris are nicely soft and puffed up, crisp on the top and thick in the bottom. It's a stomach filler, and tastes spicy, sour and oily along with Saagu. The Saagu could be better. -                    CTR the most popular and the oldest South Indian fast food restaurant. Located in the most iconic area of Bangalore, the Malleshwaram.

When server came to ask our order without hesitation we ordered two Benne Masala Dosa.. For this only I travelled 20kms early on Saturday morning.. So I was  eagerly waiting for my Masala Dosa and finally it came..  The Dosa was so rich in butter... You can feel that when the first piece goes into your mouth.. This is one of the best Masala Dosa I ever had in Bangalore.. So when I finished my first Dosa I ordered again one more Masala Dosa and my friend ordered Kesari bath and coffee.. I never drink coffee but when my friend described about the coffee I really wanted to try... This was our experience in CTR today.. Everyone in Bangalore should go and taste their food...

-                                            This place is Sunday starter. Amazing dosas and vada. Speed service.  Over loaded crowd,  best to go. Early mornings. Bangalore is known for such places and this is one of the oldest and famous place. #Regularvisitor
-                                            Best Dosas. Visit this place for probably the Best Benne Masala Dosas in Bangalore... They also have the other breakfast regulars, but everyone starts with the Dosa....If coming here on a weekend, best you start early and inform the waiters of your presence if there is a rush, wait times are around 10 mins to be seated. You probably would...
-                                            Best benne masala dosa in Bengaluru ❤❤❤The place is filled at 8.30 in the morning with people from everywhere. We waited for about 10 minutes to even get a table. But all that is forgotten once they serve their mouth watering benne masala dosa. The service is super quick even though there are so many people pouring into this old Tiffin Room. Gonna come back here quite often from now :D
-                                            Bestest dosas in Bangalore. Located on the main Margosa road, this corner store is always full. It's my favourite one .I've tried MTR, Janardhan, umesh dosa, chalukya. Name it. But CTr kills it for me. The benne plain is ultimate. If your in for an overload of ghee ,crispy golden dosas ,you are in for a treat. The red chutney they put inside the dosa is delicious.The ghee dosa goes perfectly with their filter coffee which is nice an strong.it comes in traditional steel glasses. The staff is polite and always around . This place is a quick meal one but be prepared to wait for a table. It's a sharing tiffin system so nothing fancy about it but great food and great quality.
-                                            Amazing benne dosa served here. The place is always over crowded but worth the wait. Would appreciate if they start up with token system to get in .....

-                                            Finally managed to visit the much heard about  breakfast joint. It was a Saturday morning and the place was full to the brim. We had to stand next to a table, I bet the diners were pestered with our hungry eyes waiting for them to vacate the seats just as we felt when others waited to find a seat. Amazing benne dosa and commonplace chutney. The rava dosa didn't pass muster too. Good coffees.  Will go back for the benne (butter) dosa.
-                                            All the dosa lovers out there, this is your place! By far one of the best dosas I've had in Bangalore! Hot Mangaluru bajjis served with chutney could make a nice evening snack. Love the Rava idlis and kharabath too. Such substantial food for much pocket friendly prices.
-                    Known to be one of the legendary restaurants in Bangalore, i have been planning to visit this place for a long time. I finally got a chance to visit it  last Saturday. Very easy to locate in Malleshwaram in front of by 2 coffee, you will realize how great this place is with the crowd you see outside. I had always heard its very crowded. And it surely was. It took me 10 minutes to find a seat but the wait was worth it. While we sat, the service was real quick. The waiter came for the order. I was a lil surprised to know they dont have the menu, so i asked him to help me with the order placing. With his help, we ordered puri sabzi, rava idli and benne dosa. This place has received various award and one of it was for benne dosa, so i had to try that out. Puri sabzi came, a set of 3 puri and sambhar. I wanted  aloo along so i asked the waiter an he got it without any hesitation. The poori bhaji was amazing. Then came the benne dosa, i lved how crisp and tasty it was. Mouthwatering literally, served with sambhar and amazing coconut white chutney which i ate entirely. Then came rava idly, the idly was good. We then ordered filter kaapi. Amazingly strong taste. Overall an amazing experience. The staff is great. Service is quick and a pocket friendly place. Do try.<span></span>                                              -                        Known to be one of the legendary restaurants in Bangalore, i have been planning to visit this place for a long time.

-                                            Shree Sagar or CTR as it is more popularly known is a landmark breakfast joint in Bangalore. And for good reason. Their delicious iconic Benne Masala Dosas help you forgive all the butter/ ghee rather easily. If there was just ONE thing we were allowed to have for the rest of our lives, it would be their benne saagu dosa. . yumm!They also sell some of *the* best mangalore bajjis in town, so don't forget to try them the next time you visit CTR!
-                                            What can be said about this place, as it is an icon food joint and has been here from ages.I remember visiting this place for breakfast on weekends after a tiring sports session at Malleshwaram grounds. Taste at its best and service is super fast.The quantity, quality and freshness of the food gives one a real kick. The mangalore bajji is an attraction by itself in the evenings.Reminds me of the old Bangalore that we have been  used to.
-                                            One of the most delicious food joints in banglore.The best manglore bajji's you can get. Don't miss the delicious Benne dosas over here. Aboslutely worth the visit. Love it💞
-                                            Another landmark restaurant of Bangalore ! The place is always crowded and is known for its legendary benne masala dosa and golibaje! The dosa today was a bit too crisp ! The palya was good ( mushy and with onions).  The coffee strong and was served hot !
-                                            One of the oldest restaurants of bangalore. Famous for its benne dosa...worth a visit for dosa lovers you get crispy,tasty dosa made in ghee...No great ambience just like a local hotel.There would always be a queue but moves forward quickly. The service is good..
