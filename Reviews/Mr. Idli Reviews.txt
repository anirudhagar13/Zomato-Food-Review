-                                            I went with my freind to have a snack the price is over the moon and the taste n food presentation is not value for money the ambiance is OK  as it is in the food court of gopalan grand mall
-                                            Surprised at the low ratings ... Though other items in menu are average but You get one of best Kanchipuram masala dosa here. Strongly recommend it
-                                            Unnecessarily costly.. Landed up here bcoz there was no other option in gopalan..   Someone can get the same on the roadside or even better with 1/10th of the cost
-                                            I'm going to make this review short and sour like our experience at this outlet : mundane fare,  overpriced and poor food service system.  Staff are uninterested. Couldn't wait to leave. Ordinary is an overstatement.
-                                            If you are an ardent Idli fan, wouldn't mind recycling the leftover idly to Upma, not just a fan of authentic Idlis but also the modified versions of it, also don't care spending extra bucks for Idlis in the mall, then you wouldn't mind trying Mr. Idli. So Mr. Idli is located amidst various food outlets in Gopalan Signature Mall. Its not a fancy setup, its a regular outlet in the food court with comfortable seating.-                                            Mr. Idli is not only just about varieties of idli. They have many other things which are pretty good. For eg. their Dosas are absolutely tasty. They can easily give A2B a run for their money. They are located on the second level of the Gopalan Signature mall. The cashier/owner (I guess so!!) is very polite. Service is quick.If you are in Gopalan Mall, you can stop here for a quick bite of South Indian food. It also doesn't dig a hole in the pocket aa well.
-                                            We have ordered dosa, idli, and some chinese fusion idlis. Very very overpriced south indian food. Very bad service. Greasy oily idli manchurian. sambar was yuck.. Never going to visit that outlet again
-                                            Average Overpriced Idlies are served and the service time is really bad. The staff are rude and half the menu items are not available even in peak times on weekend. Have eaten twice and am probably not visiting again.
-                                            Mr Idli furnishes a menu that is unique among most vegetarian restaurants with ample varieties of dishes. Boy! I couldn't make up my mind. The ambience and price is alright. Most of the dishes are at standard rates while a few are overpriced. The service is quick but and organised. The food is delicious. A shout out to Mr Idli! A must try. Overall, a filling and satisfactory dining experience.
-                                            Lack of choices at early hours landed us to this outlet. Must say name sounds good, the mascot is enticing and all the goodness ends right there. We ordered button idlis with ghee sambar and let me tell you it was the worst sambar i have had in a long time. Idlis were good but the sambar was absolutely bland. It is outrightly, outrageously overpriced food that may leave you questioning your sense of discernment. -                                            Was such a mistake to visit this restaurant at the Gopalan Grand Mall. We ordered Masala Dosa, Chol Bhature, Uthapam and butter milk. Everything was so disappointing that we felt like puking after half the food. We just left the food half eaten.Now their food -The food was tasteless, probably stale as well. Their service was fast as probably very few orders were received.You should compare the footfall with Mast Kalandar which is always full even though it is North Indian.-                                            One of the few restaurant that weave ambience, taste and hospitality into one thread to provide great customer experience. Well this is one of the most lavish places where I have been so far. The ambience is just a bliss. Food was mind blowing, the service and courtesy of the staff and the manager is really excellent. Itâ€™s worth. Thanks Mr Idli
-                                            The worst hotel i ever went. No fresh idli. Service is very fast as nothing is freshly cooked. All preserved frozen and heat before served. Chutney was stale. I can't even compare with any roadside hotels
-                                            I decided to come here after some shopping! I saw the menu and ordered a Mysore Cheese Rocket Dosa! I wanted to give this a try! My word its delicious! It looked nice and was quite different from other regular dosas. The cheese was nicely spread and podi was good! I was very happy the quality of the Dosa. I'd love to come here again! This place will fill your stomach! Must try Mysore Rocket cheese Dosa!
-                                            Today we went there and ordered Kanchipuram Dosa (that was their special dish for the day (Saturday)) and Idli Manchurian. Idli Manchurian was good but not exactly happy with the dosa. It's really overpriced as with the price of 120+ , I feel it is really costly. In Bangalore you'd get better places which is having much better value for money. I don't like the taste of Sambar too, served with Dosa. Overall I could have given 3.5 but due to price I finally settled to mark 3 rating
-                                            This place surprises one with explosive food on one hand and some let downs also on the the other. Visited this place for a quick bite as well as for a meal - can't say I was disappointed. It has more pluses than negatives and with just a few tweaks can be a very good joint. Worth giving a try!
-                                            Went to this place as we were very hungry after some shopping @Gopalan signature mall. Ordered a Mysore Rocket Cheese masala dosa. I was fascinated by this fancy name and decided to try it. -                                            Its okkkkkaaaayyy place but expensive... dosa batter wasnt tadty n sambar n chutney had kind of dour smell n tadty... not upto the level of pricing...
-                                            Located inside gopalan signature mall. Staff is nice. Self service. Have tried idli only. Not so pricy. And yes Idli manchurian is a must try.
-                                            Went to this place on a Sunday morning. Had Mini Idlies with sambar, Bombay special open dosa, Idly manchurian and coffee. Sambar was good. Open dosa is just an Uthappam (which is very very thick) with some podi, aloo sagu on it. Nothing special, and was not expecting that way. Idly manchurian was nothing like a manchurian. I think they ve added red colour fried it in a bit of oil and added spring onions, tomato sauce and onions. I was tasting the tomato sauce all over it. Bad... May be i was expecting too much for it. But all the above costed around 350 which i think is a bit highly priced. Coffee was good though!
-                                            Looking for South Indian food in a resto, you've got it here. All kinds of dosa and other things. Whenever we feel like South Indian from outside we come here. Food is fine here as it should be.
-                                            South Indian Food is the best way to stay healthy. However we were a bit sceptical about eating out.However coming to Gopalan Signature Mall and ordering food at Mr.Idli, we found ourselves enjoying the ambience and literally devouring the food. We ordered a lot of items, of which I loved the Onion Dosas as well as the rava idlis. I can conclude by saying that this is definitely the place, where it feels like a home away from home and you can enjoy the taste of delicious home made food.
-                                            Mr. Idli is too costly for having Idli's.  It's costs me around 100 rupees to fill my stomach with Idli's there,  but outside at normal eatery it costs me only 40-50 rupees.  It's not worth going there
-                                            Now, a wide variety of Idlis is something you will find only at this place. I visited this restaurant and had the food in a hurry as I was supposed to catch 10 pm movie :) . This one is situated in Gopalan Signature Mall, Old Madras Road.Loaded Onion Uthappam is simply superb here. As the name suggests, the Uthappam is actually loaded with a LOADS of onions I must say. Button Ghee Idly with Sambar is equally delicious. Mulagapudi Ghee Idly is something you must not miss. Button Idlis are soaked in a powder (probably made of garlic and other stuff) and later Ghee is sprinkled on the Idlis. Really, really tasty. Sambar is of great taste. I think they can improve the taste of chutneys. They are OK but not the best.-                                            I put up in Kasturi Nagar, and this is one of my closest hangout places. I have tried everything in the mall, apart from this. Finally, I went with my friends to the place. The food is OK, i liked Idli Machurian and Chilli Idli, apart from this Rava Dosa and Onion Uthapam were Okish.Its a nice place for light food.The cashier and the waiters are good people to talk to.
-                                            Amazing place for snacking. Love the Mini Idli and Uttapam options. The chutneys are fresh and super tasty.
-                                            Worst idly available in Bangalore. Waste of money. Chutneys I guess they prepare in the morning and setve entire day. Cant cut the idly with a spoon so hard.
-                                            Worst serviceWorst qualityPrices very high.-                    I had seen Mr Idli during one of my previous visits to the mall, but had not tried it. Last weekend I happened to be at the mall and had to find some place for lunch. As I was alone, I wasn't looking forward to an elaborate meal or anything. Hence Mr Idli! It is an open seating area within the mall and the decor and seating is pretty basic. Although there were many items listed in the menu, I was informed that for lunch only Meals and Dosas were available. I would have preferred Bisi Bele Bath, but that wasn't available :(. I could see several kinds of Dosas, and some of them with interesting combos.. For example the Taco Noodle Dosa. Not one to take such big risks I settled for the American Corn Pudina Dosa. Cost me 110 bucks, and I was given a token. Service was quick; the fact the place wasn't fully crowded helped. The Dosa was basically made with green colored batter with american corn sprinkled inside, and served with red and white chutney and sambar. The Dosa was crisp and roast, just like the way I prefer. It green color did not make much of a difference to the taste. The corn tasted like it was just taken off the freezer! Apart from that everything else about the Dosa was good. It was quite filling. I had to go back for extra chutney and sambar given how less they served in the first place. Except for the cold corn, I was pretty happy with what I ate. Prices are little on the higher side, so I hope they become a little more generous with the Chutney-Sambar quantity :-)

-                                            The podi idli is something you shouldn't come back without trying. Its awesome. Other idli and dosa  varieties are good too.  Simple but good food. Remember to ask for podi idli.
