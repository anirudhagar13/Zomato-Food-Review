-                                Place is inside the locality main road, and there is no parking space at all.... , taste was good, pocket friendly, good place to go after a long walk in gandhi bazaar
-                                One the best chutney and idly is so soft that it will just melt in ur mouth..crispy Uddina vada and tasty khaara bath..Awesome coffee..It is my regular place for a quick snack in the evening..
-                                I've been here a few times. The vadas are pretty good. I absolutely love the kesari bath here since they also add Vermicelli in it, Which really compliments the taste. -                                Some of the best idli-vada you'll eat in your life. The filter coffee is amazing and makes me proud to be a South Indian. Unlimited chutney refills. Take that, Taco Bell.
-                                Ideal place for an early morning idli. The idlis are soaked in liquid chutney unlike conventional sambar. The outlet opens exactly at 6am and serves hot idlis and vadas  that is worth waking up early.
-                                Getting to Bangalore early by train means that you can reach before the opening time of Brahmins. It's a legendary place that still serves the epic Idli vada that I've loved and their awesome chutney. -                                You want to know what is the bestest and tastiest idli?? Well, this is the place which will give your mouth a feeling of craving more and more. Nice and clean place. Self service. Tables are arranged outside to keep your plates. Best part is idli which is soft and delicious and once you place it in your mouth, it melts. Coconut chutney is very mouth watering. You can get it unlimited since there is one man who sits along with big pot only with the chutney. :)Don't miss it - do visit. You will not regret for sure.
-                                Extremely over hyped. Maybe there is some nostalgic value in this place but as a south Indian breakfast outlet it is no way comparable to Taza Thindi in jayanagar.Be it food taste, ambience or price, Taza Thindi is better in every regard.
-                                I love this place, they say "you're not a true banglorian, if you haven't had idly" not only idly,,, coffee is also the best... Sometimes U have to Chuck ambience to enjoy the tastiest food. Cheers.
-                                Was travelling via Basavanagudi early morning so had to try at this place and it dint dissapoint me at all.    Vada and chutney was crispy and spicy, the way i like it and coffee too was good. Must try this place if you are near by.
-                                            Heard about this place alot when i went to bangalore. I was really looking forward to visit this place and try the legendary soft idli and crispy vada i heard about.The place small in size and most of the time it is filled with people,you might having your food outside the cafe on table standing.-                                            Serves the best Idlis in this side of Bangalore. Legendary i would add. I feel the prices are a bit high compared to other idli outlets of the same calibre in Bangalore. Yet its a must visit. Its crowded heavily so dont expect to have a peaceful meal if u are here.Ambiance: No SeatingFood: 4.5/5-                                            Classic is the word u can say abt this place ... It's old school it's old Bangalore just the way we loved it back then ... Look at their name board it's not flashy it's not some neon lights it's a classic painted board with the same old 90s fonts üòç. Food here is awesome I mean they hav a very limited menu but that's the way they maintain quality and serve their customers soo well ... No words to say abt idlys it's totally awesome... And coffee üòòüòòüòòüòò daaaaaaaaamn gooood... Awesome place ppl ...

Simple minimalistic food. Cheap prices. Quality food. Clean place. Nothing to give less than 5. Idly, Vada, Kesar bath, UPMA - everything is amazingly tasty. Best place in Bangalore for early morning breakfast. Cheers!
-                                            This is legendary place for idlis and uddin vada . This is one of those must eat breakfast joints in bengaluru . The place is always crowded with hardly any place to stand and it's just 4 items on the menu , idli , vada , khara bath and kesri bath ...with amazing green chutney u will keep going back for more ...over all an amazing place u must try ....cheers
-                                            It's said well begun is half done.... A great breakfast will mark the course of your day. One of best places to have filter coffee. Piping hot idli, crispy case with a great blend of chutney sure fills you up with energy. Kesari bath makes you getting up worthwhile. This cafe has selected items on menu, it's clean, no seating but good provision to stand and eat. -                                            Worth driving all the way to relish on some hot and soft idly and crispy delicious vada with some spicy coriander chutney. Brahmin's coffee bar is definitely a must visit and must try the coffee. Kesari bath is also nice. Cheers. :)
-                                            Brahmin's coffee Bar, a legendary place which doesn't compromise on quality. Easily the best idli- vada in town, the idlis are very soft and they just melt in your mouth.The vada was served hot and wasn't oily, just the way I like it. Their chutney is spicy and unique. Their kesaribath is just too good to be missed out, but just watch out for the oil(ghee) in it.The kesaribath also had shevige in it, which is something I liked. Coming to the coffee, Just tasted the way actual filter coffee tastes back home. As we cultivate coffee in coorg, I know exactly how the authentic filter coffee tastes like.
-                                            No place can ever compete with this place. The aroma of the chutney drags the customers in. The combinations of crisp vadas and soft idlis with spicy chutney is just lipsmacking. The coffee in the end of a filling meal is so good that you can literally forget everything and just sit here and get lost in that cup of coffee on a rainy day.Keep it up!
-                                            Brahmin's coffee bar undoubtedly serves some of the south Indian dishes in Bangalore. From mouthwatering idlies to crispy vada nothing is taken for granted here. Everything stands out with its own character of taste. The idlies literally just melt in your mouth and you can hear the crisp as you break and chow down those amazing vadas. Khara bath has the texture of butter (so smooth). Filter coffee is a must try here. You get extra chutney from a different counter.This place has been here since ages and has maintained the quality in terms of food and discipline that goes into the making. That is the reason the place gets flooded with hungry people within minutes after opening the doors. Cleanliness and hygiene is of the highest priority here. I would definitely recommend this place as a must try for all foodies.-                                            One of the legendary hotels in Bangalore know for their best Idly and Vada along with the irresistible mouth watering chutney. No place in Bangalore can beat their Soft and tasty idly, even their vada's are so crisp and fried to perfect golden brown that you cannot resist when you see them. Their chutney is so tasty that you can literally drink it with no hiccup. -                                            Who doesn't love idli vade and authentic filter coffee on a cold rainy day? This place opened ages ago and still people go there to eat yummy food which hasn't changed it's menu as well as the taste.If you are a Bangalorean and if you don't visit this place then you are missing something which is worth.-                                            Walked into Brahmin Coffee Bar with sky high expectations ( I mean the Zomato community thinks its a 4.9 ) and walked out feeling very content. An unassuming place with no real seating or ambience to speak of, Brahmin Coffee Bar does its limited menu phenomenally well. The idlys are soft and melt in your mouth ( pay the Rs. 8 and get the butter on them ) and so is the staple Khara Bath. The highlight however is the coffee, Im not a coffee drinker and I had to rely on my breakfast company for this part of my review, but in his words "easily the best in  Bangalore".
-                                            A small place with a very simple menu, serving amazing idli vada with only chatni. The price is very less and totally worth the taste! The refreshing coffee at the end, makes the perfect breakfast.
-                                            The small shabby place in bylanes of basavanagudi is known for the mesmerising idli and vada they serve... The best after VEENA STORES in Bangalore.The upma is also good ... They pour chutney on the idli and vada, tastes yummmmieFinish it off with a strong filter coffeeA breakfast for 2 costs Rs 100/- and a must visitHighly recommended and too crowded.Parking again a challenge.. Not kid friendly -                                            When ever I go here ,I tell myself "I am goona eat 2 idili and a vada " But I end up binge eating.I am a fan of carbs so I love idili and vada , and  please go here even if you are not a carbs fan.-                                            Upma mattu coffee..!! Ds s the beat combination in here..!! Coffee is so good...!!! I love coffee and upma combination here...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
